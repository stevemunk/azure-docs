# Azure Deployment Environments Azure CLI extension

In addition to the Azure admin portal and the developer portal, you can use the Deployment Environments Azure CLI extension to create resources. Azure Deployment Environments and Microsoft Dev Box use the same Azure CLI extension, which is called `devcenter`.

## Install the Deployment Environments CLI extension 

To install the Deployment Environments Azure CLI extension, you first need to install the Azure CLI. The following steps show you how to install the Azure CLI, then the Deployment Environments CLI extension.

1. Download and install the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

1. Install the Deployment Environments CLI extension
``` azurecli
az extension add --name devcenter
```
1. Check that the `devcenter` extension is installed 
``` azurecli
az extension list
```
### Update the Deployment Environments CLI extension
You can update the Deployment Environments CLI extension if you already have it installed.

To update a version of the extension that's  installed
``` azurecli
az extension update --name devcenter
```
### Remove the Deployment Environments CLI extension

To remove the extension, use the following command
```azurecli
az extension remove --name devcenter
```

## Get started with the Deployment Environments CLI extension

You might find the following commands useful as you work with the Deployment Environments CLI extension.

1. Sign in to Azure CLI with your work account.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Set your default subscription to the subscription where you're creating your specific Deployment Environments resources.

    ```azurecli
    az account set --subscription {subscriptionId}
    ```

1. Set default resource group. Setting a default resource group means you don't need to specify the resource group for each command.

    ```azurecli
    az configure --defaults group={resourceGroupName}
    ```

1. Get Help for a command

    ```azurecli
    az devcenter admin --help
    ```
