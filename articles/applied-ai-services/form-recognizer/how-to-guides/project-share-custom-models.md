# Share custom model projects using Form Recognizer Studio

Form Recognizer Studio is an online tool to visually explore, understand, train, and integrate features from the Form Recognizer service into your applications. Form Recognizer Studio enables project sharing feature within the custom extraction model. Projects can be shared easily via a project token. The same project token can also be used to import a project.

## Prerequisite

In order to share and import your custom extraction projects seamlessly, both users (user who shares and user who imports) need an An active [**Azure account**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/).  If you don't have one, you can [**create a free account**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). Also, both users need to configure permissions to grant access to the Form Recognizer and storage resources.

## Granted access and permissions

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > Custom model projects can be imported only if you have the access to the storage account that is associated with the project you are trying to import. Check your storage account permission before starting to share or import projects with others.

### Managed identity

Enable a system-assigned managed identity for your Form Recognizer resource. A system-assigned managed identity is enabled directly on a service instance. It isn't enabled by default; you must go to your resource and update the identity setting.

For more information, *see*, [Enable a system-assigned managed identity](../managed-identities.md#enable-a-system-assigned-managed-identity)

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

Grant your Form Recognizer managed identity access to your storage account using Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC). The [Storage Blob Data Contributor](../../..//role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#storage-blob-data-reader) role grants read, write, and delete permissions for Azure Storage containers and blobs.

For more information, *see*, [Grant access to your storage account](../managed-identities.md#grant-access-to-your-storage-account)

### Configure cross origin resource sharing (CORS)

CORS needs to be configured in your Azure storage account for it to be accessible to the Form Recognizer Studio. You can update the CORS setting in the Azure portal.

Form more information, *see* [Configure CORS](../quickstarts/try-form-recognizer-studio.md#configure-cors)

### Virtual networks and firewalls

If your storage account VNet is enabled or if there are any firewall constraints, the project can't be shared. If you want to bypass those restrictions, ensure that those settings are turned off.

A workaround is to manually create a project using the same settings as the project being shared.

### User sharing requirements

Users sharing the project need to create a project [**`ListAccountSAS`**](/rest/api/storagerp/storage-accounts/list-account-sas) to configure the storage account CORS and a [**`ListServiceSAS`**](/rest/api/storagerp/storage-accounts/list-service-sas) to generate a SAS token for *read*, *write* and *list* container's file in addition to blob storage data *update* permissions.

### User importing requirements

Users who want to import the project need a [**`ListServiceSAS`**](/rest/api/storagerp/storage-accounts/list-service-sas) to generate a SAS token for *read*, *write* and *list* container's file in addition to blob storage data *update* permissions.
