The Form Recognizer business card model combines powerful Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities with deep learning models to analyze and extract data from business card images. The API analyzes printed business cards; extracts key information such as first name, last name, company name, email address, and phone number;  and returns a structured JSON data representation.

## Business card data extraction

Business cards are a great way to represent a business or a professional. The company logo, fonts and background images found in business cards help promote the company branding and differentiate it from others. Applying OCR and machine-learning based techniques to automate scanning of business cards is a common image processing scenario. Enterprise systems used by sales and marketing teams typically have business card data extraction capability integration into for the benefit of their users.

### Try business card data extraction

See how data, including name, job title, address, email, and company name, is extracted from business cards. You need the following resources:

* An Azure subscription—you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)

* A [Form Recognizer instance](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFormRecognizer) in the Azure portal. You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service. After your resource deploys, select **Go to resource** to get your key and endpoint.
