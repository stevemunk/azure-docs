# Form Recognizer v3.0 migration

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Form Recognizer REST API v3.0 introduces breaking changes in the REST API request and analyze response JSON.

## Migrating from a v3.0 preview API version

Preview APIs are periodically deprecated. If you're using a preview API version, plan on updating your application to target the GA API version once available. To migrate from the 2021-09-30-preview or the 2022-01-30-preview API versions to the `2022-08-31` (GA) API version using the SDK, update to the [current version of the language specific SDK](sdk-overview.md).

The `2022-08-31` API has a few updates from the preview API versions:

* Field rename:  boundingBox to polygon to support non-quadrilateral polygon regions.
* Field deleted: entities removed from the result of the general document model.
* Field rename: documentLanguage.languageCode to locale
* Added support for HEIF format
* Added paragraph detection, with role classification for layout and general document models.
* Added support for parsed address fields.

## Migrating from v2.1

Form Recognizer v3.0  introduces several new features and capabilities:

* [Form Recognizer REST API](quickstarts/get-started-sdks-rest-api.md?view=form-recog-3.0.0&preserve-view=true) has been redesigned for better usability.
* [**General document (v3.0)**](concept-general-document.md) model is a new API that extracts text, tables, structure, and key-value pairs, from forms and documents.
* [**Custom neural model (v3.0)**](concept-custom-neural.md) is a new custom model type to extract fields from structured and unstructured documents.
* [**Receipt (v3.0)**](concept-receipt.md) model supports single-page hotel receipt processing.
* [**ID document (v3.0)**](concept-id-document.md) model supports endorsements, restrictions, and vehicle classification extraction from US driver's licenses.
* [**Custom model API (v3.0)**](concept-custom.md) supports signature detection for custom template models.
* [**Custom model API (v3.0)**](overview.md) supports analysis of all the newly added prebuilt models. For a complete list of prebuilt models, see the [overview](overview.md) page.

In this article, you'll learn the differences between Form Recognizer v2.1 and v3.0 and how to move to the newer version of the API.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> * REST API **2022-08-31** release includes a breaking change in the REST API analyze response JSON.
> * The `boundingBox` property is renamed to `polygon` in each instance.

## Changes to the REST API endpoints

 The v3.0 REST API combines the analysis operations for layout analysis, prebuilt models, and custom models into a single pair of operations by assigning **`documentModels`**  and  **`modelId`** to the layout analysis (prebuilt-layout) and prebuilt models.

### POST request

```http
https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{modelId}?api-version=2022-08-31

```

### GET request

```http
https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{modelId}/AnalyzeResult/{resultId}?api-version=2022-08-31
```

### Analyze operation

* The request payload and call pattern remain unchanged.
* The Analyze operation specifies the input document and content-specific configurations, it returns the analyze result URL via the Operation-Location header in the response.
* Poll this Analyze Result URL, via a GET request to check the status of the analyze operation (minimum recommended interval between requests is 1 second).
* Upon success, status is set to succeeded and [analyzeResult](#changes-to-analyze-result) is returned in the response body. If errors are encountered, status will be set to `failed`, and an error will be returned.

| Model | v2.1 | v3.0 |
|:--| :--| :--|
| **Request URL prefix**| **https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/v2.1**  | **https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer** |
| **General document**|N/A|`/documentModels/prebuilt-document:analyze` |
| **Layout**| /layout/analyze |`/documentModels/prebuilt-layout:analyze`|
|**Custom**| /custom/{modelId}/analyze    |`/documentModels/{modelId}:analyze` |
| **Invoice** | /prebuilt/invoice/analyze    | `/documentModels/prebuilt-invoice:analyze` |
| **Receipt** | /prebuilt/receipt/analyze    | `/documentModels/prebuilt-receipt:analyze` |
| **ID document** | /prebuilt/idDocument/analyze |  `/documentModels/prebuilt-idDocument:analyze` |
|**Business card**| /prebuilt/businessCard/analyze| `/documentModels/prebuilt-businessCard:analyze`|
|**W-2**| /prebuilt/w-2/analyze| `/documentModels/prebuilt-w-2:analyze`|

### Analyze request body

The content to be analyzed is provided via the request body. Either the URL or base64 encoded data can be user to construct the request.

  To specify a publicly accessible web URL, set  Content-Type to **application/json** and send the following JSON body:

  ```json
  {
    "urlSource": "{urlPath}"
  }
  ```

Base64 encoding is also supported in Form Recognizer v3.0:

```json
{
  "base64Source": "{base64EncodedContent}"
}
```

### Additionally supported parameters

Parameters that continue to be supported:

* `pages` : Analyze only a specific subset of pages in the document. List of page numbers indexed from the number `1` to analyze. Ex. "1-3,5,7-9"
* `locale` : Locale hint for text recognition and document analysis. Value may contain only the language code (ex. "en", "fr") or BCP 47 language tag (ex. "en-US").

Parameters no longer supported:

* includeTextDetails

The new response format is more compact and the full output is always returned.

## Changes to analyze result

Analyze response has been refactored to the following top-level results to support multi-page elements.

* `pages`
* `tables`
* `keyValuePairs`
* `entities`
* `styles`
* `documents`

> [!NOTE]
>
> The analyzeResult response changes includes a number of changes like moving up from a property of pages to a top lever property within analyzeResult.

```

## Build or train model

The model object has three updates in the new API

* ```modelId``` is now a property that can be set on a model for a human readable name.
* ```modelName``` has been renamed to ```description```
* ```buildMode``` is a new property with values of  ```template``` for custom form models or ```neural``` for custom neural models.

The ```build``` operation is invoked to train a model. The request payload and call pattern remain unchanged. The build operation specifies the model and training dataset, it returns the result via the Operation-Location header in the response. Poll this model operation URL, via a GET request to check the status of the build operation (minimum recommended interval between requests is 1 second). Unlike v2.1, this URL isn't the resource location of the model. Instead, the model URL can be constructed from the given modelId, also retrieved from the resourceLocation property in the response. Upon success, status is set to ```succeeded``` and result contains the custom model info. If errors are encountered, status is set to ```failed```, and the error is returned.

The following code is a sample build request using a SAS token. Note the trailing slash when setting the prefix or folder path.

```json
POST https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/documentModels:build?api-version=2022-08-31

{
  "modelId": {modelId},
  "description": "Sample model",
  "buildMode": "template",
  "azureBlobSource": {
    "containerUrl": "https://{storageAccount}.blob.core.windows.net/{containerName}?{sasToken}",
    "prefix": "{folderName/}"
  }
}
```

## Changes to compose model

Model compose is now limited to single level of nesting. Composed models are now consistent with custom models with the addition of ```modelId``` and ```description``` properties.

```json
POST https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/documentModels:compose?api-version=2022-08-31
{
  "modelId": "{composedModelId}",
  "description": "{composedModelDescription}",
  "componentModels": [
    { "modelId": "{modelId1}" },
    { "modelId": "{modelId2}" },
  ]
}
  
```

## Changes to copy model

The call pattern for copy model remains unchanged:

* Authorize the copy operation with the target resource calling ```authorizeCopy```. Now a POST request.
* Submit the authorization to the source resource to copy the model calling ```copyTo```
* Poll the returned operation to validate the operation completed successfully

The only changes to the copy model function are:

* HTTP action on the ```authorizeCopy``` is now a POST request.
* The authorization payload contains all the information needed to submit the copy request.

***Authorize the copy***

```json
POST https://{targetHost}/formrecognizer/documentModels:authorizeCopy?api-version=2022-08-31
{
  "modelId": "{targetModelId}",
  "description": "{targetModelDescription}",
}
```

Use the response body from the authorize action to construct the request for the copy.

```json
POST https://{sourceHost}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{sourceModelId}:copyTo?api-version=2022-08-31
{
  "targetResourceId": "{targetResourceId}",
  "targetResourceRegion": "{targetResourceRegion}",
  "targetModelId": "{targetModelId}",
  "targetModelLocation": "https://{targetHost}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{targetModelId}",
  "accessToken": "{accessToken}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2021-08-02T03:56:11Z"
}
```

## Changes to list models

List models have been extended to now return prebuilt and custom models. All prebuilt model names start with ```prebuilt-```. Only models with a status of succeeded are returned. To list models that either failed or are in progress, see [List Operations](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/form-recognizer-api-v3-0-preview-1/operations/GetModels).

***Sample list models request***

```json
GET https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/documentModels?api-version=2022-08-31
```

## Change to get model

As get model now includes prebuilt models, the get operation returns a ```docTypes``` dictionary. Each document type is described by its name, optional description, field schema, and optional field confidence. The field schema describes the list of fields potentially returned with the document type.

```json
GET https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/documentModels/{modelId}?api-version=2022-08-31
```

## New get info operation

The ```info``` operation on the service returns the custom model count and custom model limit.

```json
GET https://{your-form-recognizer-endpoint}/formrecognizer/info? api-version=2022-08-31
```

***Sample response***

```json
{
  "customDocumentModels": {
    "count": 5,
    "limit": 100
  }
}
```
