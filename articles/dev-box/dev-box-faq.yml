    questions:
      - question: Which repository providers does Dev Box support?
        answer: Dev Box supports GitHub, Azure Repos, and Bitbucket repositories to provide an image gallery for Dev Box.  
                For more information, see [Configure Azure Compute Gallery for Microsoft Dev Box](how-to-configure-azure-compute-gallery.md)

      - question: Dev boxes that I create from my custom image take an hour to provision and up to 30 minutes to start. How do I make provisioning and startup faster? # Question.
        answer: |
          When you create a generalized VM to capture to an image, the following issues can impact provisioning and startup times:
          1. Enable the Read/Write cache on the OS disk. 
             - To verify, open the Azure portal and navigate to the image. Select **JSON view**, and make sure `properties.storageProfile.osDisk.caching` value is `ReadWrite`.
          2. Create the image using the following sysprep options: `/mode:vm flag: Sysprep /generalize /oobe /mode:vm`.
             - This prevents a lengthy search for and installation of drivers during the first boot.
          3. Enable nested virtualization in your base image.
             - In the UI, open **Turn Windows features on or off** and select **Virtual Machine Platform**. 
             - Or run the following PowerShell command, Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform -Online 
          4. Disable the reserved storage state feature in the image by using the following command: `DISM.exe /Online /Set-ReservedStorageState /State:Disabled`.

      - question: How can I check my Dev Box quota? # Question.
        answer: |
