# Materialized views for Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL (preview)

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The materialized view feature of Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL is currently in preview. You can enable this feature using the Azure portal. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement. At this time, materialized views are not recommended for production workloads. Certain features of this preview may not be supported or may have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [supplemental terms of use for Microsoft Azure previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Many times applications are required to make queries that don't specify the partition key. In these cases, the queries could scan through all data for a small result set. The queries end up being expensive as they end up inadvertently executing as a cross-partition query.

Materialized views, when defined, help provide a means to efficiently query a base container in Azure Cosmos DB with filters that don't include the partition key. When users write to the base container, the materialized view is built automatically in the background. This view can have a different partition key for efficient lookups. The view also only contains fields explicitly projected from the base container. This view is a read-only table.

With a materialized view, you can:

- Use the view as lookup or mapping container to persist cross-partition scans that would otherwise be expensive queries.
- Provide a SQL-based predicate (without conditions) to populate only specific fields.
- Create real-time views that simplify event-based scenarios that are commonly stored as separate containers using change feed triggers.

Materialized views have many benefits that include, but aren't limited to:

- You can implement server-side denormalization using materialized views. With server-side denormalization, you can avoid multiple independent tables and computationally complex denormalization in client applications.
- Materialized views automatically update views to keep them consistent with the base container. This automatic update abstracts the responsibilities of your client applications that would otherwise typically implement custom logic to perform dual writes to the base container and the view.
- Materialized views optimize read performance by reading from a single view.
- You can specify throughput for the materialized view independently.
- You can configure a materialized view builder layer to map to your requirements to hydrate a view.
- Materialized views improve write performance (when compared to multi-container-write strategy) as write operations only need to be written to the base container.
- Additionally, the Azure Cosmos DB implementation of materialized views is based on a pull model. This implementation doesn't affect write performance.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Azure Cosmos DB account.
  - If you have an Azure subscription, [create a new account](how-to-create-account.md?tabs=azure-portal).
  - If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
  - Alternatively, you can [try Azure Cosmos DB free](../try-free.md) before you commit.

## Enable materialized views

Use the Azure CLI to enable the materialized views feature either with a native command or a REST API operation on your Cosmos DB for NoSQL account.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to your API for NOSQL account.

1. In the resource menu, select **Settings**.

1. In the **Features** section under **Settings**, toggle the **Materialized View for NoSQL API (Preview)** option to **On**.

1. In the new dialog, select **Enable** to enable this feature for the account.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Sign-in to the Azure CLI.

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information on installing the Azure CLI, see [how to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

1. Define the variables for the resource group and account name for your existing API for NoSQL account.

    ```azurecli
    # Variable for resource group name
    resourceGroupName="<resource-group-name>"
    
    # Variable for account name
    accountName="<account-name>"
    
    # Variable for Subscription
    subscriptionId="<subscription-id>"
    ```

1. Create a new JSON file named **capabilities.json** with the capabilities manifest.

    ```json
    {
      "properties": {
        "enableMaterializedViews": true
      }
    }
    ```

1. Get the identifier of the account and store it in a shell variable named `$accountId`.

    ```azurecli
    accountId="/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/$accountName"
    ```

1. Enable the preview materialized views feature for the account using the REST API and [`az rest`](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-rest) with an HTTP `PATCH` verb.

    ```azurecli
    az rest \
        --method PATCH \
        --uri "https://management.azure.com/$accountId?api-version=2022-11-15-preview" \
        --body @capabilities.json
    ```

---

## Create a materialized view builder

Create a materialized view builder to automatically transform data and write to a materialized view.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Navigate to your API for NoSQL account.

1. In the resource menu, select **Materialized Views Builder**.

1. On the **Materialized Views Builder** page, configure the SKU and number of instances for the builder.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This resource menu option and page will only appear when the Materialized Views feature is enabled for the account.

1. Select **Save**.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Create a new JSON file named **builder.json** with the builder manifest.

    ```json
    {
      "properties": {
        "serviceType": "materializedViewsBuilder",
        "instanceCount": 1,
        "instanceSize": "Cosmos.D4s"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Enable the materialized views builder for the account using the REST API and `az rest` with an HTTP `PUT` verb.

    ```azurecli
    az rest \
        --method PUT \
        --uri "https://management.azure.com$accountId/services/materializedViewsBuilder?api-version=2022-11-15-preview" \
        --body @builder.json
    ```

1. Wait for a couple of minutes and check the status using `az rest` again with the HTTP `GET` verb. The status in the output should now be `Running`:

    ```azurecli
    az rest \
        --method GET \
        --uri "https://management.azure.com$accountId/services/materializedViewsBuilder?api-version=2022-11-15-preview"
    ```

Azure Cosmos DB For NoSQL uses a materialized view builder compute layer to maintain the views.

You get the flexibility to configure the view builder's compute instances based on your latency and lag requirements to hydrate the views. From a technical stand point, this compute layer helps manage connections between partitions in a more efficient manner even when the data size is large and the number of partitions is high.

The compute containers are shared among all materialized views within an Azure Cosmos DB account. Each provisioned compute container spawns off multiple tasks that read the change feed from base container partitions and writes data to the target materialized view\[s\]. The compute container transforms the data per the materialized view definition for each materialized view in the account.

## Create a materialized view

Once your account and Materialized View Builder is set up, you should be able to create Materialized views using  REST API.

### [Azure portal / Azure CLI](#tab/azure-portal+azure-cli)

1. Use the Azure portal, Azure SDK, Azure CLI, or REST API to create a source container with `/accountId` as the partition key path. Name this source container **mv-src**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > `/accountId` is only used as an example in this article. For your own containers, select a partition key that works for your solution.

1. Insert a few items in the source container. To better understand this Getting Started, make sure that the items mandatorily have `accountId`, `fullName`, and `emailAddress` fields. A sample item could look like this:

    ```json
    {
      "accountId": "prikrylova-libuse",
      "emailAddress": "libpri@contoso.com",
      "name": {
        "first": "Libuse",
        "last": "Prikrylova"
      }
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this example, you populate the source container with sample data. You can also create a materialized view from an empty source container.

1. Now, create a materialized view named **mv-target** with a partition key path that is different from the source container. For this example, specify `/emailAddress` as the partition key path for the **mv-target** container.

    1. First, we create a definition manifest for a materialized view and save it in a JSON file named **definition.json**.

        ```json
        {
          "location": "North Central US",
          "tags": {},
          "properties": {
            "resource": {
              "id": "mv-target",
              "partitionKey": {
                "paths": [
                  "/emailAddress"
                ],
                "kind": "Hash"
              },
              "materializedViewDefinition": {
                "sourceCollectionId": "mv-src",
                "definition": "SELECT s.accountId, s.emailAddress FROM s"
              }
            },
            "options": {
              "throughput": 400
            }
          }
        }        
        ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the template, notice that the partitionKey path is set as `/emailAddress`. We also have more parameters to specify the source collection and the definition to populate the materialized view.

1. Now, make a REST API call to create the materialized view as defined in the **mv_definition.json** file. Use the Azure CLI to make the REST API call.

    1. Create a variable for the name of the materialized view and source database name.

        ```azurecli
        materializedViewName="mv-target"
        
        # Variable for database name used in later section
        databaseName="<database-that-contains-source-collection>"
        ```

    1. Make a REST API call to create the materialized view.

        ```azurecli
        az rest \
            --method PUT \
            --uri "https://management.azure.com$accountId/sqlDatabases/";\
                  "$databaseName/containers/$materializedViewName?api-version=2022-11-15-preview" \
            --body @definition.json \
            --headers content-type=application/json
        ```

    1. Check the status of the materialized view container creation using the REST API:

        ```azurecli
        az rest \
            --method GET \
            --uri "https://management.azure.com$accountId/sqlDatabases/";\
                  "$databaseName/containers/$materializedViewName?api-version=2022-11-15-preview" \
            --headers content-type=application/json \
            --query "{mvCreateStatus: properties.Status}"
        ```

---

Once the materialized view is created, the materialized view container automatically syncs changes with the source container. Try executing CRUD operations in the source container and observe the same changes in the mv container.

> [!NOTE]
> Materialized View containers are read-only container for the end-user so they can only be modified automatically by the Materialized View Builders.

## Current limitations

There are a few limitations with the Cosmos DB NoSQL API Materialized View Feature while in preview:

- Materialized views can't be created on a container that existed before support for materialized views was enabled on the account. To use materialized views, create a new container after the feature is enabled.
- `WHERE` clauses aren't supported in the materialized view definition.
- You can only project source container items' JSON object property list in the materialized view definition. Now, the list can only contain one level of properties in the JSON tree.
- In the materialized view definition, aliases aren't supported for fields of documents.
- It's recommended to create a materialized view when the source container is still empty or has only a few items.
- Restoring a container from a backup doesn't restore materialized views. You need to re-create the materialized views after the restore process is complete.
- All materialized views defined on a specific source container must be deleted before deleting the source container.
- point-in-time restore, hierarchical partitioning, end-to-end encryption isn't supported on source containers, which have materialized views associated with them.
- Role-based access control is currently not supported for materialized views.
- Cross-tenant customer-managed-key (CMK) encryption isn't supported on materialized views.
- Currently, this feature can't be enabled along with Partition Merge feature, Analytical Store, or Continuous Backup mode.

In addition to the above limitations, consider the following extra limitations:

- Availability zones
  - Materialized views can't be enabled on an account that has availability zone enabled regions.
  - Adding a new region with an availability zone isn't supported once `enableMaterializedViews` is set to `true` on the account.
- Periodic backup and restore
  - Materialized views aren't automatically restored with the restore process. You'll need to re-create the materialized views after the restore process is complete. Then, you should configure `enableMaterializedViews` on their restored account before creating the materialized views and builders again.
