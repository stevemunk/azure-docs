# Product updates for Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [PostgreSQL](../includes/appliesto-postgresql.md)]

## Release notes

Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL gets updated regularly.

Updates that donâ€™t directly affect the internals of a cluster are rolled out gradually to [all supported regions](resources-regions.md). Once such an update is rolled out to a region, it's available immediately on all new and existing Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL clusters in that region.

Updates that change cluster internals, such as installing a [new minor PostgreSQL version](https://www.postgresql.org/developer/roadmap/), are delivered to existing clusters as part of the next [scheduled maintenance](concepts-maintenance.md) event. Such updates are available immediately to newly created clusters.

### June  2023
