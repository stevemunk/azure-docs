# Enable Profiler for Azure Service Fabric applications

Application Insights Profiler is included with Azure Diagnostics. You can install the Azure Diagnostics extension by using an Azure Resource Manager template for your Service Fabric cluster. Get a [template that installs Azure Diagnostics on a Service Fabric Cluster](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docs-json-samples/blob/master/application-insights/ServiceFabricCluster.json).

In this article, you will:

- Add the Application Insights Profiler property to your Azure Resource Manager template.
- Deploy your Service Fabric cluster with the Application Insights Profiler instrumentation key.
- Enable Application Insights on your Service Fabric application.
- Redeploy your Service Fabric cluster to enable Profiler.

## Prerequisites

- Profiler supports .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET Core [LTS](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) and newer applications.
  - Verify you're using [.NET Framework 4.6.1](/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed) or later. 
  - Confirm that the deployed OS is `Windows Server 2012 R2` or later. 
- [An Azure Service Fabric managed cluster](../../service-fabric/quickstart-managed-cluster-portal.md).

## Create deployment template

1. In your Service Fabric managed cluster, navigate to where you've implemented the [Azure Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docs-json-samples/blob/master/application-insights/ServiceFabricCluster.json).

1. Locate the `WadCfg` tags in the [Azure Diagnostics](../agents/diagnostics-extension-overview.md) extension in the deployment template file.

1. Add the following `SinksConfig` section as a child element of `WadCfg`. Replace the `ApplicationInsightsProfiler` property value with your own Application Insights instrumentation key:  

  ```json
  "settings": {
      "WadCfg": {
          "SinksConfig": {
              "Sink": [
                  {
                      "name": "MyApplicationInsightsProfilerSinkVMSS",
                      "ApplicationInsightsProfiler": "YOUR_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY"
                  }
              ]
          },
      },
  }  
  ```

  For information about adding the Diagnostics extension to your deployment template, see [Use monitoring and diagnostics with a Windows VM and Azure Resource Manager templates](../../virtual-machines/extensions/diagnostics-template.md).

## Deploy your Service Fabric cluster

After updating the `WadCfg` with your instrumentation key, deploy your Service Fabric cluster.  
  
Application Insights Profiler will be installed and enabled when the Azure Diagnostics extension is installed. 

## Enable Application Insights on your Service Fabric application

For Profiler to collect profiles for your requests, your application must be tracking operations with Application Insights. 

- **For stateless APIs**, you can refer to instructions for [tracking requests for profiling](./profiler-trackrequests.md). 
- **For tracking custom operations in other kinds of apps**, see [track custom operations with Application Insights .NET SDK](../app/custom-operations-tracking.md).

Redeploy your application once you've enabled Application Insights.

## Generate traffic and view Profiler traces

1. Launch an [availability test](/previous-versions/azure/azure-monitor/app/monitor-web-app-availability) to generate traffic to your application. 
1. Wait 10 to 15 minutes for traces to be sent to the Application Insights instance.
1. View the [Profiler traces](./profiler-overview.md) via the Application Insights instance the Azure portal.
