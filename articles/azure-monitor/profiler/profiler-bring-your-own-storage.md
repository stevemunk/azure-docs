# Configure Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS) for Application Insights Profiler and Snapshot Debugger

## What is Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS) and why might I need it?

When you use Application Insights Profiler or Snapshot Debugger, artifacts generated by your application are uploaded into Azure storage accounts over the public Internet. For these artifacts and storage accounts, Microsoft controls and covers the cost for:

* Processing and analysis.
* Encryption-at-rest and lifetime management policies.

When you configure Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS), artifacts are uploaded into a storage account that you control. That means you control and are responsible for the cost of:

* The encryption-at-rest policy and the Lifetime management policy.
* Network access.

> [!NOTE]
> BYOS is required if you are enabling Private Link or Customer-Managed Keys.

> * [Learn more about Private Link for Application Insights](../logs/private-link-security.md).
> * [Learn more about Customer-Managed Keys for Application Insights](../logs/customer-managed-keys.md).

## How will my storage account be accessed?

1. Agents running in your Virtual Machines or App Service will upload artifacts (profiles, snapshots, and symbols) to blob containers in your account.

    This process involves contacting the Profiler or Snapshot Debugger service to obtain a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token to a new blob in your storage account.

1. The Profiler or Snapshot Debugger service will:

    1. Analyze the incoming blob.
    1. Write back the analysis results and log files into blob storage.
  
    Depending on available compute capacity, this process may occur anytime after upload.

1. When you view the Profiler traces or Snapshot Debugger analysis, the service fetches the analysis results from blob storage.

## Prerequisites

* Create your Storage Account in the same location as your Application Insights resource.

    For example, if your Application Insights resource is in West US 2, your Storage Account must be also in West US 2.

* Grant the `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role to the Azure AD application named `Diagnostic Services Trusted Storage Access` via the [Access Control (IAM)](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md) page in your storage account.
* If Private Link is enabled, allow connection to our Trusted Microsoft Service from your virtual network.

## Enable BYOS

### Grant Access to Diagnostic Services to your Storage Account

A BYOS storage account will be linked to an Application Insights resource. There may be only one storage account per Application Insights resource and both must be in the same location. You may use the same storage account with more than one Application Insights resource.

First, the Application Insights Profiler, and Snapshot Debugger service needs to be granted access to the storage account. To grant access, add the role `Storage Blob Data Contributor` to the Azure AD application named `Diagnostic Services Trusted Storage Access` via the Access Control (IAM) page in your storage account as shown in Figure 1.0.

Steps:

1. Select **Access control (IAM)**.

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment** to open the Add role assignment page.

1. Assign the following role. For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).
  
    | Setting | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Role | Storage Blob Data Contributor |
    | Assign access to | User, group, or service principal |
    | Members | Diagnostic Services Trusted Storage Access |

If you're also using Private Link, it's required one additional configuration to allow connection to our Trusted Microsoft Service from your Virtual Network. or more information, see [Storage Network Security documentation](../../storage/common/storage-network-security.md#trusted-microsoft-services).

### Link your Storage Account with your Application Insights resource

To configure BYOS for code-level diagnostics (Profiler/Debugger), there are three options:

* Using Azure PowerShell cmdlets.
* Using the Azure CLI.
* Using Azure Resource Manager templates.

#### [PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

1. Make sure you have installed Az PowerShell 4.2.0 or greater.

    To install Azure PowerShell, refer to the [Official Azure PowerShell documentation](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

1. Install the Application Insights PowerShell extension.

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name Az.ApplicationInsights -Force
    ```

1. Sign in with your Azure account subscription.

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount -Subscription "{subscription_id}"
    ```

    For more information on how to sign in, refer to the [Connect-AzAccount documentation](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount).

1. Remove previous Storage Account linked to your Application Insights resource.

    Pattern:

    ```powershell
    $appInsights = Get-AzApplicationInsights -ResourceGroupName "{resource_group_name}" -Name "{application_insights_name}"
    Remove-AzApplicationInsightsLinkedStorageAccount -ResourceId $appInsights.Id
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    $appInsights = Get-AzApplicationInsights -ResourceGroupName "byos-test" -Name "byos-test-westus2-ai"
    Remove-AzApplicationInsightsLinkedStorageAccount -ResourceId $appInsights.Id
    ```

1. Connect your Storage Account with your Application Insights resource.
  
    Pattern:

    ```powershell
    $storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "{resource_group_name}" -Name "{storage_account_name}"
    $appInsights = Get-AzApplicationInsights -ResourceGroupName "{resource_group_name}" -Name "{application_insights_name}"
    New-AzApplicationInsightsLinkedStorageAccount -ResourceId $appInsights.Id -LinkedStorageAccountResourceId $storageAccount.Id
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    $storageAccount = Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "byos-test" -Name "byosteststoragewestus2"
    $appInsights = Get-AzApplicationInsights -ResourceGroupName "byos-test" -Name "byos-test-westus2-ai"
    New-AzApplicationInsightsLinkedStorageAccount -ResourceId $appInsights.Id -LinkedStorageAccountResourceId $storageAccount.Id
    ```

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Make sure you have installed Azure CLI.

    To install Azure CLI, refer to the [Official Azure CLI documentation](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

1. Install the Application Insights CLI extension.

    ```azurecli
    az extension add -n application-insights
    ```

1. Connect your Storage Account with your Application Insights resource.

    Pattern:

    ```azurecli
    az monitor app-insights component linked-storage link --resource-group "{resource_group_name}" --app "{application_insights_name}" --storage-account "{storage_account_name}"
    ```
  
    Example:

    ```azurecli
    az monitor app-insights component linked-storage link --resource-group "byos-test" --app "byos-test-westus2-ai" --storage-account "byosteststoragewestus2"
    ```
  
    Expected output:

    ```powershell
    {
      "id": "/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourcegroups/byos-test/providers/microsoft.insights/components/byos-test-westus2-ai/linkedstorageaccounts/serviceprofiler",
      "linkedStorageAccount": "/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/byos-test/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/byosteststoragewestus2",
      "name": "serviceprofiler",
      "resourceGroup": "byos-test",
      "type": "microsoft.insights/components/linkedstorageaccounts"
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > For performing updates on the linked Storage Accounts to your Application Insights resource, refer to the [Application Insights CLI documentation](/cli/azure/monitor/app-insights/component/linked-storage).

#### [Resource Manager Template](#tab/azure-resource-manager)

1. Create an Azure Resource Manager template file with the following content (*byos.template.json*):

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {
        "applicationinsights_name": {
          "type": "String"
        },
        "storageaccount_name": {
          "type": "String"
        }
      },
      "variables": {},
      "resources": [
        {
          "name": "[concat(parameters('applicationinsights_name'), '/serviceprofiler')]",
          "type": "Microsoft.Insights/components/linkedStorageAccounts",
          "apiVersion": "2020-03-01-preview",
          "properties": {
            "linkedStorageAccount": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('storageaccount_name'))]"
          }
        }
      ],
      "outputs": {}
    }
    ```

1. Run the following PowerShell command to deploy the above template:

    Syntax:

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "{your_resource_name}" -TemplateFile "{local_path_to_arm_template}"
    ```

    Example:

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "byos-test" -TemplateFile "D:\Docs\byos.template.json"
    ```

1. Provide the following parameters when prompted in the PowerShell console:
  
    |           Parameter           |                                Description                               |
    |-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `application_insights_name`     | The name of the Application Insights resource to enable BYOS.            |
    | `storage_account_name`          | The name of the Storage Account resource that you'll use as your BYOS. |
  
    Expected output:

    ```powershell
    Supply values for the following parameters:
    (Type !? for Help.)
    application_insights_name: byos-test-westus2-ai
    storage_account_name: byosteststoragewestus2
