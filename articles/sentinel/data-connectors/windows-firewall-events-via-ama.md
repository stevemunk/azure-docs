# Windows Firewall Events via AMA (Preview) connector for Microsoft Sentinel

Windows Firewall is a Microsoft Windows application that filters information coming to your system from the internet and blocking potentially harmful programs. The firewall software blocks most programs from communicating through the firewall. Customers wishing to stream their Windows Firewall application logs collected from their machines can now use the AMA to stream those logs to the Microsoft Sentinel workspace.
