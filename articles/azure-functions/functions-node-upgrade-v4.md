# Upgrade to version 4 of the Node.js programming model for Azure Functions

This article discusses the differences between version 3 and version 4 of the Node.js programming model and how to upgrade an existing v3 app. If you want to create a brand new v4 app instead of upgrading an existing v3 app, see the tutorial for either [VS Code](./create-first-function-cli-node.md) or [Azure Functions Core Tools](./create-first-function-vs-code-node.md). This article uses "TIP" sections to highlight the most important concrete actions you should take to upgrade your app.

Version 4 was designed with the following goals in mind:

- Provide a familiar and intuitive experience to Node.js developers
- Make the file structure flexible with support for full customization
- Switch to a code-centric approach for defining function configuration

[!INCLUDE [Programming Model Considerations](../../includes/functions-nodejs-model-considerations.md)]

## Requirements

Version 4 of the Node.js programming model requires the following minimum versions:

- [`@azure/functions`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/functions) npm package v4.0.0-alpha.9+
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) v18+
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) v4+
- [Azure Functions Runtime](./functions-versions.md) v4.16+
- [Azure Functions Core Tools](./functions-run-local.md) v4.0.5095+ (if running locally)

## Enable v4 programming model

The following application setting is required to run the v4 programming model while it is in preview: 
- Name: `AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags`
- Value: `EnableWorkerIndexing`

If you're running locally using [Azure Functions Core Tools](functions-run-local.md), you should add this setting to your `local.settings.json` file. If you're running in Azure, follow these steps with the tool of your choice:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli-set-indexing-flag)

Replace `<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>` and `<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>` with the name of your function app and resource group, respectively.

```azurecli 
az functionapp config appsettings set --name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> --settings AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags=EnableWorkerIndexing
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell-set-indexing-flag)

Replace `<FUNCTION_APP_NAME>` and `<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>` with the name of your function app and resource group, respectively.

```azurepowershell
Update-AzFunctionAppSetting -Name <FUNCTION_APP_NAME> -ResourceGroupName <RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME> -AppSetting @{"AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags" = "EnableWorkerIndexing"}
```

# [VS Code](#tab/vs-code-set-indexing-flag)

1. Make sure you have the [Azure Functions extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) installed
1. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to open the command palette. In the command palette, search for and select `Azure Functions: Add New Setting...`.
1. Choose your subscription and function app when prompted
1. For the name, type `AzureWebJobsFeatureFlags` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. 
1. For the value, type `EnableWorkerIndexing` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

## Include the npm package

For the first time, the [`@azure/functions`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/functions) npm package contains the primary source code that backs the Node.js programming model. In previous versions, that code shipped directly in Azure and the npm package only had the TypeScript types. Moving forward, you need to include this package for both TypeScript and JavaScript apps. You _can_ include the package for existing v3 apps, but it isn't required.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure the `@azure/functions` package is listed in the `dependencies` section (not `devDependencies`) of your `package.json` file. You can install v4 with the command 
> ```
> npm install @azure/functions@preview
> ```

## Set your app entry point

In v4 of the programming model, you can structure your code however you want. The only files you need at the root of your app are `host.json` and `package.json`. Otherwise, you define the file structure by setting the `main` field in your `package.json` file. The `main` field can be set to a single file or multiple files by using a [glob pattern](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)). Common values for the `main` field may be:
- TypeScript
    - `dist/src/index.js`
    - `dist/src/functions/*.js`
- JavaScript
    - `src/index.js`
    - `src/functions/*.js`

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you define a `main` field in your `package.json` file

## Switch the order of arguments

The trigger input is now the first argument to your function handler instead of the invocation context. The invocation context, now the second argument, was simplified in v4 and isn't as required as the trigger input - it can be left off if you aren't using it.

> [!TIP]
> Switch the order of your arguments. For example if you are using an http trigger, switch `(context, request)` to either `(request, context)` or just `(request)` if you aren't using the context.

## Define your function in code

Say goodbye ðŸ‘‹ to `function.json` files! All of the configuration that was previously specified in a `function.json` file is now defined directly in your TypeScript or JavaScript files. In addition, many properties now have a default so that you don't have to specify them every time.

# [v4](#tab/v4)

```javascript
const { app } = require("@azure/functions");

app.http('helloWorld1', {
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
  handler: async (request, context) => {
    context.log('Http function processed request');

    const name = request.query.get('name') 
      || await request.text() 
      || 'world';

    return { body: `Hello, ${name}!` };
  }
});
```

# [v3](#tab/v3)

```javascript
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
  context.log('HTTP function processed a request');

  const name = req.query.name
    || req.body
    || 'world';

  context.res = {
    body: `Hello, ${name}!`
  };
};
```

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "anonymous",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

> [!TIP]
> Move the config from your `function.json` file to your code. The type of the trigger will correspond to a method on the `app` object in the new model. For example, if you use an `httpTrigger` type in `function.json`, you will now call `app.http()` in your code to register the function. If you use `timerTrigger`, you will now call `app.timer()` and so on.


## Review your usage of context

The `context` object has been simplified to reduce duplication and make it easier to write unit tests. For example, we streamlined the primary input and output so that they're only accessed as the argument and return value of your function handler. The primary input and output can't be accessed on the `context` object anymore, but you must still access _secondary_ inputs and outputs on the `context` object. For more information about secondary inputs and outputs, see the [Node.js developer guide](./functions-reference-node.md#extra-inputs-and-outputs).

### Get the primary input as an argument

The primary input is also called the "trigger" and is the only required input or output. You must have one and only one trigger.

# [v4](#tab/v4)

v4 only supports one way of getting the trigger input, as the first argument.

```javascript
async function helloWorld1(request, context) {
  const onlyOption = request;
```

# [v3](#tab/v3)

v3 supports several different ways of getting the trigger input.

```javascript
async function helloWorld1(context, request) {
    const option1 = request;
    const option2 = context.req;
    const option3 = context.bindings.req;
```

---

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you aren't using `context.req` or `context.bindings` to get the input.

### Set the primary output as your return value

# [v4](#tab/v4)

v4 only supports one way of setting the primary output, through the return value.

```javascript
return { 
  body: `Hello, ${name}!` 
};
```

# [v3](#tab/v3)

v3 supports several different ways of setting the primary output.

```javascript
// Option 1
context.res = {
    body: `Hello, ${name}!`
};
// Option 2, but you can't use this option with any async code:
context.done(null, {
    body: `Hello, ${name}!`
});
// Option 3, but you can't use this option with any async code:
context.res.send(`Hello, ${name}!`);
// Option 4, if "name" in "function.json" is "res":
context.bindings.res = {
    body: `Hello, ${name}!`
}
// Option 5, if "name" in "function.json" is "$return":
return {
    body: `Hello, ${name}!`
};
```

---

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you are always returning the output in your function handler, instead of setting it with the `context` object.

### Create a test context

v3 doesn't support creating an invocation context outside of the Azure Functions runtime, making it difficult to author unit tests. v4 allows you to create an instance of the invocation context, although the information during tests isn't detailed unless you add it yourself.

# [v4](#tab/v4)

```javascript
const testInvocationContext = new InvocationContext({
  functionName: 'testFunctionName',
  invocationId: 'testInvocationId'
});
```

# [v3](#tab/v3)

Not possible ðŸ˜®

## Review your usage of HTTP types

The http request and response types are now a subset of the [fetch standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/fetch) instead of being types unique to Azure Functions. The types use Node.js's [`undici`](https://undici.nodejs.org/) package, which follows the fetch standard and is [currently being integrated](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/1737) into Node.js core.

### HttpRequest

# [v4](#tab/v4)
- _**Body**_. You can access the body using a method specific to the type you would like to receive:
    ```javascript
    const body = await request.text();
    const body = await request.json();
    const body = await request.formData();
    const body = await request.arrayBuffer();
    const body = await request.blob();
    ```
- _**Header**_:
    ```javascript
    const header = request.headers.get('content-type');
    ```
- _**Query param**_:
    ```javascript
    const name = request.query.get('name');
    ```

# [v3](#tab/v3)
- _**Body**_. You can access the body in several ways, but the type returned isn't always consistent:
    ```javascript
    // returns a string, object, or Buffer
    const body = request.body;
    // returns a string
    const body = request.rawBody;
    // returns a Buffer
    const body = request.bufferBody;
    // returns an object representing a form
    const body = await request.parseFormBody();
    ```
- _**Header**_. A header can be retrieved in several different ways:
    ```javascript
    const header = request.get('content-type');
    const header = request.headers.get('content-type');
    const header = context.bindingData.headers['content-type'];
    ```
- _**Query param**_:
    ```javascript
    const name = request.query.name;
    ```
---

### HttpResponse

# [v4](#tab/v4)
- _**Status**_:
    ```javascript
    return { status: 200 };
    ```
- _**Body**_:
    ```javascript
    return { body: "Hello, world!" };
    ```
- _**Header**_. You can set the header in two ways, depending if you're using the `HttpResponse` class or `HttpResponseInit` interface:
    ```javascript
    const response = new HttpResponse();
    response.headers.set('content-type', 'application/json');
    return response;
    ```
    ```javascript
    return {
      headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }
    };
    ```

# [v3](#tab/v3)
- _**Status**_. A status can be set in several different ways:
    ```javascript
    context.res.status(200);
    context.res = { status: 200}
    context.res = { statusCode: 200 };
    return { status: 200};
    return { statusCode: 200 };
    ```
- _**Body**_. A body can be set in several different ways:
    ```javascript
    context.res.send("Hello, world!");
    context.res.end("Hello, world!");
    context.res = { body: "Hello, world!" }
    return { body: "Hello, world!" };
    ```
- _**Header**_. A header can be set in several different ways:
    ```javascript
    response.set('content-type', 'application/json');
    response.setHeader('content-type', 'application/json');
    response.headers = { 'content-type': 'application/json' }
    context.res = {
      headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }
    };
    return {
      headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' }
    };
    ```

> [!TIP]
> Update any logic using the http request or response types to match the new methods. If you are using TypeScript, you should receive build errors if you use old methods.

## Troubleshooting

If you see the following error, make sure you [set the `EnableWorkerIndexing` flag](#enable-v4-programming-model) and you're using the minimum version of all [requirements](#requirements):

> No job functions found. Try making your job classes and methods public. If you're using binding extensions (e.g. Azure Storage, ServiceBus, Timers, etc.) make sure you've called the registration method for the extension(s) in your startup code (e.g. builder.AddAzureStorage(), builder.AddServiceBus(), builder.AddTimers(), etc.).

If you see the following error, make sure you're using Node.js version 18.x:

> System.Private.CoreLib: Exception while executing function: Functions.httpTrigger1. System.Private.CoreLib: Result: Failure
> Exception: undici_1.Request is not a constructor
