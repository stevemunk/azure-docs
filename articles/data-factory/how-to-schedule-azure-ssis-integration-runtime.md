# How to start and stop Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime on a schedule

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

This article describes how to schedule the starting and stopping of Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR) by using Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Synapse. Azure-SSIS IR is compute resource dedicated for executing SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages. Running Azure-SSIS IR has a cost associated with it. Therefore, you typically want to run your IR only when you need to execute SSIS packages in Azure and stop your IR when you do not need it anymore. You can use ADF or Synapse Pipelines portal or Azure PowerShell to [manually start or stop your IR](manage-azure-ssis-integration-runtime.md)).

Alternatively, you can create Web activities in ADF or Synapse pipelines to start/stop your IR on schedule, e.g. starting it in the morning before executing your daily ETL workloads and stopping it in the afternoon after they are done.  You can also chain an Execute SSIS Package activity between two Web activities that start and stop your IR, so your IR will start/stop on demand, just in time before/after your package execution. For more info about Execute SSIS Package activity, see [Run an SSIS package using Execute SSIS Package activity in ADF pipeline](how-to-invoke-ssis-package-ssis-activity.md) article.

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](../../includes/updated-for-az.md)]

## Prerequisites

### Data Factory
You will need an instance of Azure Data Factory to implement this walk through. If you do not have one already provisioned, you can follow the steps in [Quickstart: Create a data factory by using the Azure portal and Azure Data Factory Studio](quickstart-create-data-factory-portal.md).

### Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime (IR)
If you have not provisioned your Azure-SSIS IR already, provision it by following instructions in the [tutorial](./tutorial-deploy-ssis-packages-azure.md). 

## Create and schedule ADF pipelines that start and or stop Azure-SSIS IR
This section shows you how to use Web activities in ADF pipelines to start/stop your Azure-SSIS IR on schedule or start & stop it on demand. We will guide you to create three pipelines: 

1. The first pipeline contains a Web activity that starts your Azure-SSIS IR. 
2. The second pipeline contains a Web activity that stops your Azure-SSIS IR.
3. The third pipeline contains an Execute SSIS Package activity chained between two Web activities that start/stop your Azure-SSIS IR. 

After you create and test those pipelines, you can create a schedule trigger and associate it with any pipeline. The schedule trigger defines a schedule for running the associated pipeline. 

For example, you can create two triggers, the first one is scheduled to run daily at 6 AM and associated with the first pipeline, while the second one is scheduled to run daily at 6 PM and associated with the second pipeline.  In this way, you have a period between 6 AM to 6 PM every day when your IR is running, ready to execute your daily ETL workloads.  

If you create a third trigger that is scheduled to run daily at midnight and associated with the third pipeline, that pipeline will run at midnight every day, starting your IR just before package execution, subsequently executing your package, and immediately stopping your IR just after package execution, so your IR will not be running idly.

### Create your pipelines

1. In the home page, select **Orchestrate**. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-invoke-ssis-package-stored-procedure-activity/orchestrate-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Orchestrate button on the Azure Data Factory home page.":::
   
2. In the **Activities** toolbox, expand **General** menu, and drag & drop a **Web** activity onto the pipeline designer surface. In **General** tab of the activity properties window, change the activity name to **startMyIR**. Switch to **Settings** tab, and do the following actions:
    > [!NOTE]
    > For Azure-SSIS in Azure Synapse, use corresponding Azure Synapse REST API to [Get Integration Runtime status](/rest/api/synapse/integration-runtimes/get), [Start Integration Runtime](/rest/api/synapse/integration-runtimes/start) and [Stop Integration Runtime](/rest/api/synapse/integration-runtimes/stop).

   1. For **URL**, enter the following URL for REST API that starts Azure-SSIS IR, replacing `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, `{factoryName}`, and `{integrationRuntimeName}` with the actual values for your IR: `https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/{factoryName}/integrationRuntimes/{integrationRuntimeName}/start?api-version=2018-06-01`. Alternatively, you can also copy & paste the resource ID of your IR from its monitoring page on ADF UI/app to replace the following part of the above URL: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/{factoryName}/integrationRuntimes/{integrationRuntimeName}`
    
      :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/adf-ssis-ir-resource-id.png" alt-text="ADF SSIS IR Resource ID":::
  
   2. For **Method**, select **POST**. 
   3. For **Body**, enter `{"message":"Start my IR"}`.
   4. For **Authentication**, select **Managed Identity** to use the specified system managed identity for your ADF, see [Managed identity for Data Factory](./data-factory-service-identity.md) article for more info.
   5. For **Resource**, enter `https://management.azure.com/`.
    
      :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/adf-web-activity-schedule-ssis-ir.png" alt-text="ADF Web Activity Schedule SSIS IR":::
  
3. Clone the first pipeline to create a second one, changing the activity name to **stopMyIR** and replacing the following properties.

   1. For **URL**, enter the following URL for REST API that stops Azure-SSIS IR, replacing `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, `{factoryName}`, and `{integrationRuntimeName}` with the actual values for your IR: `https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/{factoryName}/integrationRuntimes/{integrationRuntimeName}/stop?api-version=2018-06-01`.
   2. For **Body**, enter `{"message":"Stop my IR"}`. 

4. Create a third pipeline, drag & drop an **Execute SSIS Package** activity from **Activities** toolbox onto the pipeline designer surface, and configure it following the instructions in [Invoke an SSIS package using Execute SSIS Package activity in ADF](how-to-invoke-ssis-package-ssis-activity.md) article.  Next, chain the Execute SSIS Package activity between two Web activities that start/stop your IR, similar to those Web activities in the first/second pipelines.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/adf-web-activity-on-demand-ssis-ir.png" alt-text="ADF Web Activity On-Demand SSIS IR":::

5. Instead of manually creating the third pipeline, you can also automatically create it from a template. To do so, select the **...** symbol next to **Pipeline** to drop down a menu of pipeline actions, select the **Pipeline from template** action, select the **SSIS** check box under **Category**, select the **Schedule ADF pipeline to start and stop Azure-SSIS IR just in time before and after running SSIS package** template, select your IR in the **Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime** drop down menu, and finally select the **Use this template** button. Your pipeline will be automatically created with only SSIS package left for you to assign to the Execute SSIS Package activity.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/adf-on-demand-ssis-ir-template.png" alt-text="ADF On-Demand SSIS IR Template":::

6. To make the third pipeline more robust, you can ensure that the Web activities to start/stop your IR are retried if there are any transient errors due to network connectivity or other issues and only completed when your IR is actually started/stopped. To do so, you can replace each Web activity with an Until activity, which in turn contains two Web activities, one to start/stop your IR and another to check your IR status. Let's call the Until activities *Start SSIS IR* and *Stop SSIS IR*.  The *Start SSIS IR* Until activity contains *Try Start SSIS IR* and *Get SSIS IR Status* Web activities. The *Stop SSIS IR* Until activity contains *Try Stop SSIS IR* and *Get SSIS IR Status* Web activities. On the **Settings** tab of *Start SSIS IR*/*Stop SSIS IR* Until activities, for **Expression**, enter `@equals('Started', activity('Get SSIS IR Status').output.properties.state)`/`@equals('Stopped', activity('Get SSIS IR Status').output.properties.state)`, respectively.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/adf-until-activity-on-demand-ssis-ir.png" alt-text="ADF Until Activity On-Demand SSIS IR":::

   Within both Until activities, the *Try Start SSIS IR*/*Try Stop SSIS IR* Web activities are similar to those Web activities in the first/second pipelines. On the **Settings** tab of *Get SSIS IR Status* Web activities, do the following actions:

   1. For **URL**, enter the following URL for REST API that gets Azure-SSIS IR status, replacing `{subscriptionId}`, `{resourceGroupName}`, `{factoryName}`, and `{integrationRuntimeName}` with the actual values for your IR: `https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/{factoryName}/integrationRuntimes/{integrationRuntimeName}?api-version=2018-06-01`.
   2. For **Method**, select **GET**. 
   3. For **Authentication**, select **Managed Identity** to use the specified system managed identity for your ADF, see [Managed identity for Data Factory](./data-factory-service-identity.md) article for more info.
   4. For **Resource**, enter `https://management.azure.com/`.
    
      :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/adf-until-activity-on-demand-ssis-ir-open.png" alt-text="ADF Until Activity On-Demand SSIS IR Open":::

7. Assign the managed identity for your ADF a **Contributor** role to itself, so Web activities in its pipelines can call REST API to start/stop Azure-SSIS IRs provisioned in it:  

   1. On your ADF page in the Azure portal, select **Access control (IAM)**.
   1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment** to open the **Add role assignment** page.
   1. Assign the following role. For detailed steps, see [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.md).

      | Setting | Value |
      | --- | --- |
      | Role | Contributor |
      | Assign access to | User, group, or service principal |
      | Members | Your ADF username |

      :::image type="content" source="../../includes/role-based-access-control/media/add-role-assignment-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Add role assignment page in Azure portal.":::

8. Validate your ADF and all pipeline settings by clicking **Validate all/Validate** on the factory/pipeline toolbar. Close **Factory/Pipeline Validation Output** by clicking **>>** button.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/test-run-output.png" alt-text="Test Run":::
    
2. To test the third pipeline, if you store your SSIS package in SSIS catalog (SSISDB), you can launch SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to check its execution. In **Connect to Server** window, do the following actions. 

    1. For **Server name**, enter **&lt;your server name&gt;.database.windows.net**.
    2. Select **Options >>**.
    3. For **Connect to database**, select **SSISDB**.
    4. Select **Connect**. 
    5. Expand **Integration Services Catalogs** -> **SSISDB** -> Your folder -> **Projects** -> Your SSIS project -> **Packages**. 
    6. Right-click the specified SSIS package to run and select **Reports** -> **Standard Reports** -> **All Executions**. 
    7. Verify that it ran. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/verify-ssis-package-run.png" alt-text="Verify SSIS package run":::

### Schedule your pipelines

Now that your pipelines work as you expected, you can create triggers to run them at specified cadences. For details about associating triggers with pipelines, see [Trigger the pipeline on a schedule](quickstart-create-data-factory-portal.md#trigger-the-pipeline-on-a-schedule) article.

1. On the pipeline toolbar, select **Trigger** and select **New/Edit**.

    1. For **Name**, enter a name for the trigger. In the following example, **Run daily** is the trigger name. 
    2. For **Type**, select **Schedule**. 
    3. For **Start Date (UTC)**, enter a start date and time in UTC. 
    4. For **Recurrence**, enter a cadence for the trigger. In the following example, it is **Daily** once. 
    5. For **End**, select **No End** or enter an end date and time after selecting **On Date**. 
    6. Select **Activated** to activate the trigger immediately after you publish the whole ADF settings. 
    7. Select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/new-trigger-window.png" alt-text="Trigger -> New/Edit":::

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-invoke-ssis-package-stored-procedure-activity/publish-all-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Publish All button."::: 

### Monitor your pipelines and triggers in Azure portal

1. To monitor trigger runs and pipeline runs, use **Monitor** tab on the left of ADF UI/app. For detailed steps, see [Monitor the pipeline](quickstart-create-data-factory-portal.md#monitor-the-pipeline) article.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/pipeline-runs.png" alt-text="Pipeline runs":::

2. To view the activity runs associated with a pipeline run, select the first link (**View Activity Runs**) in **Actions** column. For the third pipeline, you will see three activity runs, one for each chained activity in the pipeline (Web activity to start your IR, Execute SSIS Package activity to execute your package, and Web activity to stop your IR). To view the pipeline runs again, select **Pipelines** link at the top.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/activity-runs.png" alt-text="Activity runs":::

3. To view the trigger runs, select **Trigger Runs** from the drop-down list under **Pipeline Runs** at the top. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/trigger-runs.png" alt-text="Trigger runs":::

### Monitor your pipelines and triggers with PowerShell

Use scripts like the following examples to monitor your pipelines and triggers.

1. Get the status of a pipeline run.

   ```powershell
   Get-AzDataFactoryV2PipelineRun -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName -PipelineRunId $myPipelineRun
   ```

2. Get info about a trigger.

   ```powershell
   Get-AzDataFactoryV2Trigger -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName -Name  "myTrigger"
   ```

3. Get the status of a trigger run.

   ```powershell
   Get-AzDataFactoryV2TriggerRun -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -DataFactoryName $DataFactoryName -TriggerName "myTrigger" -TriggerRunStartedAfter "2018-07-15" -TriggerRunStartedBefore "2018-07-16"
   ```

## Create and schedule Azure Automation runbook that starts/stops Azure-SSIS IR

In this section, you will learn to create Azure Automation runbook that executes PowerShell script, starting/stopping your Azure-SSIS IR on a schedule.  This is useful when you want to execute additional scripts before/after starting/stopping your IR for pre/post-processing.

### Create your Azure Automation account

If you do not have an Azure Automation account already, create one by following the instructions in this step. For detailed steps, see [Create an Azure Automation account](../automation/quickstarts/create-azure-automation-account-portal.md) article. As part of this step, you create an **Azure Run As** account (a service principal in your Azure Active Directory) and assign it a **Contributor** role in your Azure subscription. Ensure that it is the same subscription that contains your ADF with Azure SSIS IR. Azure Automation will use this account to authenticate to Azure Resource Manager and operate on your resources. 

1. Launch **Microsoft Edge** or **Google Chrome** web browser. Currently, ADF UI/app is only supported in Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome web browsers.
2. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).    
3. Select **New** on the left menu, select **Monitoring + Management**, and select **Automation**. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/new-automation.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the Monitoring + Management > Automation option.":::
    
2. In **Add Automation Account** pane, do the following actions.

    1. For **Name**, enter a name for your Azure Automation account. 
    2. For **Subscription**, select the subscription that has your ADF with Azure-SSIS IR. 
    3. For **Resource group**, select **Create new** to create a new resource group or **Use existing** to select an existing one. 
    4. For **Location**, select a location for your Azure Automation account. 
    5. Confirm **Create Azure Run As account** as **Yes**. A service principal will be created in your Azure Active Directory and assigned a **Contributor** role in your Azure subscription.
    6. Select **Pin to dashboard** to display it permanently in Azure dashboard. 
    7. Select **Create**. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/add-automation-account-window.png" alt-text="New -> Monitoring + Management -> Automation":::
   
3. You will see the deployment status of your Azure Automation account in Azure dashboard and notifications. 
    
   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/deploying-automation.png" alt-text="Deploying automation":::

Enter your resource group, ADF, and Azure-SSIS IR names. For **OPERATION**, enter **STOP**. In the output window, wait for the message **##### Completed #####** after you see **##### Stopping #####**. Stopping Azure-SSIS IR does not take as long as starting it. Close **Job** window and get back to **Runbook** window.

8. You can also trigger your runbook via a webhook that can be created by selecting the **Webhooks** menu item or on a schedule that can be created by selecting the **Schedules** menu item as specified below.  

## Create schedules for your runbook to start/stop Azure-SSIS IR

In the previous section, you have created your Azure Automation runbook that can either start or stop Azure-SSIS IR. In this section, you will create two schedules for your runbook. When configuring the first schedule, you specify **START** for **OPERATION**. Similarly, when configuring the second one, you specify **STOP** for **OPERATION**. For detailed steps to create schedules, see [Create a schedule](../automation/shared-resources/schedules.md#create-a-schedule) article.

1. In **Runbook** window, select **Schedules**, and select **+ Add a schedule** on the toolbar. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/add-schedules-button.png" alt-text="Azure SSIS IR - started":::
   
2. In **Schedule Runbook** pane, do the following actions: 

    1. Select **Link a schedule to your runbook**. 
    2. Select **Create a new schedule**.
    3. In **New Schedule** pane, enter **Start IR daily** for **Name**. 
    4. For **Starts**, enter a time that is a few minutes past the current time. 
    5. For **Recurrence**, select **Recurring**. 
    6. For **Recur every**, enter **1** and select **Day**. 
    7. Select **Create**. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/new-schedule-start.png" alt-text="Schedule for Azure SSIS IR start":::
	
3. Switch to **Parameters and run settings** tab. Specify your resource group, ADF, and Azure-SSIS IR names. For **OPERATION**, enter **START** and select **OK**. Select **OK** again to see the schedule on **Schedules** page of your runbook. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-schedule-azure-ssis-integration-runtime/start-schedule.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the Operation field.":::
    
4. Repeat the previous two steps to create a schedule named **Stop IR daily**. Enter a time that is at least 30 minutes after the time you specified for **Start IR daily** schedule.
