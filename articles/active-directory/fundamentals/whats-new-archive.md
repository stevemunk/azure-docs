### Public Preview - IPv6 coming to Azure AD



**Type:** Plan for change      
**Service category:** Identity Protection            
**Product capability:** Platform     

With the growing adoption and support of IPv6 across enterprise networks, service providers, and devices, many customers are wondering if their users can continue to access their services and applications from IPv6 clients and networks. Today, we’re excited to announce our plan to bring IPv6 support to Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This allows customers to reach the Azure AD services over both IPv4 and IPv6 network protocols (dual stack).
For most customers, IPv4 won't completely disappear from their digital landscape, so we aren't planning to require IPv6 or to de-prioritize IPv4 in any Azure Active Directory features or services.
We'll begin introducing IPv6 support into Azure AD services in a phased approach, beginning March 31, 2023.
We have guidance that is specifically for Azure AD customers who use IPv6 addresses and also use Named Locations in their Conditional Access policies.

Customers who use named locations to identify specific network boundaries in their organization need to:
1. Conduct an audit of existing named locations to anticipate potential risk.
1. Work with your network partner to identify egress IPv6 addresses in use in your environment.
1. Review and update existing named locations to include the identified IPv6 ranges.

Customers who use Conditional Access location based policies to restrict and secure access to their apps from specific networks need to:
1. Conduct an audit of existing Conditional Access policies to identify use of named locations as a condition to anticipate potential risk.
1. Review and update existing Conditional Access location based policies to ensure they continue to meet your organization’s security requirements.

We continue to share additional guidance on IPv6 enablement in Azure AD at this link: https://aka.ms/azureadipv6.

### General Availability - Workload Identity Federation with App Registrations are available now

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience 

Entra Workload Identity Federation allows developers to exchange tokens issued by another identity provider with Azure AD tokens, without needing secrets. It eliminates the need to store, and manage, credentials inside the code or secret stores to access Azure AD protected resources such as Azure and Microsoft Graph. By removing the secrets required to access Azure AD protected resources, workload identity federation can improve the security posture of your organization. This feature also reduces the burden of secret management and minimizes the risk of service downtime due to expired credentials. 

For more information on this capability and supported scenarios, see [Workload identity federation](../develop/workload-identity-federation.md).

###  General Availability – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  
 

We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values&preserve-view=true).

 
We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).

### Pre-authentication error events removed from Azure AD Sign-in Logs

**Type:** Deprecated  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting  
 
We're no longer publishing sign-in logs with the following error codes because these events are pre-authentication events that occur before our service has authenticated a user. Because these events happen before authentication, our service isn't always able to correctly identify the user. If a user continues on to authenticate, the user sign-in will show up in your tenant Sign-in logs. These logs are no longer visible in the Azure portal UX, and querying these error codes in the Graph API will no longer return results.

|Error code | Failure reason|
| --- | --- |
|50058| Session information isn't sufficient for single-sign-on.|
|16000| Either multiple user identities are available for the current request or selected account isn't supported for the scenario.|
|500581| Rendering JavaScript. Fetching sessions for single-sign-on on V2 with prompt=none requires JavaScript to verify if any MSA accounts are signed in.|
|81012| The user trying to sign in to Azure AD is different from the user signed into the device.|

## November 2021

### Tenant enablement of combined security information registration for Azure Active Directory

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

### Windows users will see prompts more often when switching user accounts

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
A problematic interaction between Windows and a local Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) instance can result in users attempting to sign into another account, but be silently signed into their existing account instead, with no warning. For federated IdPs such as ADFS, that support the [prompt=login](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/ad-fs-prompt-login) pattern, Azure AD will now trigger a fresh sign-in at ADFS when a user is directed to ADFS with a sign-in hint. This ensures that the user is signed into the account they requested, rather than being silently signed into the account they're already signed in with. 

For more information, see the [change notice](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md).

## October 2021
 
### Limits on the number of configured API permissions for an application registration will be enforced starting in October 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Sometimes, application developers configure their apps to require more permissions than it's possible to grant. To prevent this from happening, a limit on the total number of required permissions that can be configured for an app registration will be enforced.

The total number of required permissions for any single application registration mustn't exceed 400 permissions, across all APIs. The change to enforce this limit will begin rolling out mid-October 2021. Applications exceeding the limit can't increase the number of permissions they're configured for. The existing limit on the number of distinct APIs for which permissions are required remains unchanged and may not exceed 50 APIs.

In the Azure portal, the required permissions are listed under API permissions for the application you wish to configure. Using Microsoft Graph or Microsoft Graph PowerShell, the required permissions are listed in the requiredResourceAccess property of an [application](/graph/api/resources/application) entity. [Learn more](../enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).

### Email one-time passcode on by default change beginning rollout in November 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Previously, we announced that starting October 31, 2021, Microsoft Azure Active Directory [email one-time passcode](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md) authentication will become the default method for inviting accounts and tenants for B2B collaboration scenarios. However, because of deployment schedules, we'll begin rolling out on November 1, 2021. Most of the tenants will see the change rolled out in January 2022 to minimize disruptions during the holidays and deployment lock downs. After this change, Microsoft will no longer allow redemption of invitations using Azure Active Directory accounts that are unmanaged. [Learn more](../external-identities/one-time-passcode.md#frequently-asked-questions).
 
---

### Conditional Access Guest Access Blocking Screen

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Conditional Access  
**Product capability:** End User Experiences
 
If there's no trust relation between a home and resource tenant, a guest user would have previously been asked to re-register their device, which would break the previous registration. However, the user would end up in a registration loop because only home tenant device registration is supported. In this specific scenario, instead of this loop, we've created a new conditional access blocking page. The page tells the end user that they can't get access to conditional access protected resources as a guest user. [Learn more](../external-identities/b2b-quickstart-add-guest-users-portal.md#prerequisites).
 
---

### 50105 Errors will now result in a UX error message instead of an error response to the application

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Azure AD has fixed a bug in an error response that occurs when a user isn't assigned to an app that requires a user assignment. Previously, Azure AD would return error 50105 with the OIDC error code "interaction_required" even during interactive authentication. This would cause well-coded applications to loop indefinitely, as they do interactive authentication and receive an error telling them to do interactive authentication, which they would then do.  

The bug has been fixed, so that during non-interactive auth an "interaction_required" error will still be returned. Also, during interactive authentication an error page will be directly displayed to the user.  

For greater details, see the change notices for [Azure AD protocols](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#error-50105-has-been-fixed-to-not-return-interaction_required-during-interactive-authentication).

### Public preview - New claims transformation capabilities

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps  
**Product capability:** SSO
 
The following new capabilities have been added to the claims transformations available for manipulating claims in tokens issued from Azure AD:
 
- Join() on NameID. Used to be restricted to joining an email format address with a verified domain. Now Join() can be used on the NameID claim in the same way as any other claim, so NameID transforms can be used to create Windows account style NameIDs or any other string. For now if the result is an email address, the Azure AD will still validate that the domain is one that is verified in the tenant.
- Substring(). A new transformation in the claims configuration UI allows extraction of defined position substrings such as five characters starting at character three - substring(3,5)
- Claims transformations. These transformations can now be performed on Multi-valued attributes, and can emit multi-valued claims. Microsoft Graph can now be used to read/write multi-valued directory schema extension attributes. [Learn more](../develop/active-directory-saml-claims-customization.md).

### Public preview - Azure Active Directory workload identity federation

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Enterprise Apps  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Azure AD workload identity federation is a new capability that's in public preview. It frees developers from handling application secrets or certificates. This includes secrets in scenarios such as using GitHub Actions and building applications on Kubernetes. Rather than creating an application secret and using that to get tokens for that application, developers can instead use tokens provided by the respective platforms such as GitHub and Kubernetes without having to manage any secrets manually.[Learn more](../develop/workload-identity-federation.md).

### General availability - Google deprecation of Gmail sign-in support on embedded webviews on September 30, 2021

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Google has deprecated Gmail sign-ins on Microsoft Teams mobile and custom apps that run Gmail authentications on embedded webviews on Sept. 30th, 2021.

If you would like to request an extension, impacted customers with affected OAuth client ID(s) should have received an email from Google Developers with the following information regarding a one-time policy enforcement extension, which must be completed by Jan 31, 2022.

To continue allowing your Gmail users to sign in and redeem, we strongly recommend that you refer to [Embedded vs System Web](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) UI in the MSAL.NET documentation and modify your apps to use the system browser for sign-in. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default. 

As a workaround, we're deploying the device sign-in flow by October 8. Between today and until then, it's likely that it may not be rolled out to all regions yet (in which case, end-users will be met with an error screen until it gets deployed to your region.) 

For more details on the device sign-in flow and details on requesting extension to Google, see [Add Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](../external-identities/google-federation.md#deprecation-of-web-view-sign-in-support).

## September 2021

### Limits on the number of configured API permissions for an application registration will be enforced starting in October 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
Occasionally, application developers configure their apps to require more permissions than it's possible to grant. To prevent this from happening, we're enforcing a limit on the total number of required permissions that can be configured for an app registration.

The total number of required permissions for any single application registration must not exceed 400 permissions, across all APIs. The change to enforce this limit will begin rolling out no sooner than mid-October 2021. Applications exceeding the limit can't increase the number of permissions they're configured for. The existing limit on the number of distinct APIs for which permissions are required remains unchanged and can't exceed 50 APIs.

In the Azure portal, the required permissions are listed under Azure Active Directory > Application registrations > (select an application) > API permissions. Using Microsoft Graph or Microsoft Graph PowerShell, the required permissions are listed in the requiredResourceAccess property of an application entity. [Learn more](../enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).

### Single Page Apps using the `spa` redirect URI type must use a CORS enabled browser for auth

**Type:** Known issue  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Developer Experience
 
The modern Edge browser is now included in the requirement to provide an `Origin` header when redeeming a [single page app authorization code](../develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow.md#redirect-uris-for-single-page-apps-spas). A compatibility fix accidentally exempted the modern Edge browser from CORS controls, and that bug is being fixed during October. A subset of applications depended on CORS being disabled in the browser, which has the side effect of removing the `Origin` header from traffic. This is an unsupported configuration for using Azure AD, and these apps that depended on disabling CORS can no longer use modern Edge as a security workaround.  All modern browsers must now include the `Origin` header per HTTP spec, to ensure CORS is enforced. [Learn more](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#the-device-code-flow-ux-will-now-include-an-app-confirmation-prompt).

## July 2021

### New Google sign-in integration for Azure AD B2C and B2B self-service sign-up and invited external users will stop working starting July 12, 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 
Previously we announced that [the exception for Embedded WebViews for Gmail authentication will expire in the second half of 2021](https://www.yammer.com/cepartners/threads/1188371962232832).

On July 7, 2021, we learned from Google that some of these restrictions will apply starting **July 12, 2021**. Azure AD B2B and B2C customers who set up a new Google ID sign-in in their custom or line of business applications to invite external users or enable self-service sign-up will have the restrictions applied immediately. As a result, end-users will be met with an error screen that blocks their Gmail sign-in if the authentication is not moved to a system webview. See the docs linked below for details. 

Most apps use system web-view by default, and will not be impacted by this change. This only applies to customers using embedded webviews (the non-default setting.) We advise customers to move their application's authentication to system browsers instead, prior to creating any new Google integrations. To learn how to move to system browsers for Gmail authentications, read the Embedded vs System Web UI section in the [Using web browsers (MSAL.NET)](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) documentation. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default. [Learn more](../external-identities/google-federation.md#deprecation-of-web-view-sign-in-support).

### Google sign-in on embedded web-views expiring September 30, 2021

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C
 

About two months ago we announced that the exception for Embedded WebViews for Gmail authentication will expire in the second half of 2021. 

Recently, Google has specified the date to be **September 30, 2021**. 

Rolling out globally beginning September 30, 2021, Azure AD B2B guests signing in with their Gmail accounts will now be prompted to enter a code in a separate browser window to finish signing in on Microsoft Teams mobile and desktop clients. This applies to invited guests and guests who signed up using Self-Service Sign-Up. 

Azure AD B2C customers who have set up embedded webview Gmail authentications in their custom/line of business apps or have existing Google integrations, will no longer can let their users sign in with Gmail accounts. To mitigate this, make sure to modify your apps to use the system browser for sign-in. For more information, read the Embedded vs System Web UI section in the [Using web browsers (MSAL.NET)](../develop/msal-net-web-browsers.md#embedded-vs-system-web-ui) documentation. All MSAL SDKs use the system web-view by default. 

As the device sign-in flow will start rolling out on September 30, 2021, it's likely that it may not be rolled out to your region yet (in which case, your end-users will be met with the error screen shown in the documentation until it gets deployed to your region.) 

For details on known impacted scenarios and what experience your users can expect, read [Add Google as an identity provider for B2B guest users](../external-identities/google-federation.md#deprecation-of-web-view-sign-in-support).

### Unrequested but consented permissions will no longer be added to tokens if they would trigger Conditional Access

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** Platform
 
Currently, applications using [dynamic permissions](../develop/v2-permissions-and-consent.md#requesting-individual-user-consent) are given all of the permissions they're consented to access. This includes applications that are unrequested and even if they trigger conditional access. For example, this can cause an app requesting only `user.read` that also has consent for `files.read`, to be forced to pass the Conditional Access assigned for the `files.read` permission. 

To reduce the number of unnecessary Conditional Access prompts, Azure AD is changing the way that unrequested scopes are provided to applications. Apps will only trigger conditional access for permission they explicitly request. For more information, read [What's new in authentication](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#conditional-access-will-only-trigger-for-explicitly-requested-scopes).

### Azure AD on-premises Hybrid Agents Impacted by Azure TLS Certificate Changes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** N/A  
**Product capability:** Platform

Microsoft is updating Azure services to use TLS certificates from a different set of Root Certificate Authorities (CAs). This update is due to the current CA certificates not complying with one of the CA/Browser Forum Baseline requirements. This change will impact Azure AD hybrid agents installed on-premises that have hardened environments with a fixed list of root certificates and will need to be updated to trust the new certificate issuers.

This change will result in disruption of service if you don't take action immediately. These agents include [Application Proxy connectors](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AppProxy) for remote access to on-premises, [Passthrough Authentication](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that allow your users to sign in to applications using the same passwords, and [Cloud Provisioning Preview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/AzureADConnect) agents that perform AD to Azure AD sync. 

If you have an environment with firewall rules set to allow outbound calls to only specific Certificate Revocation List (CRL) download, you'll need to allow the following CRL and OCSP URLs. For full details on the change and the CRL and OCSP URLs to enable access to, see  [Azure TLS certificate changes](../../security/fundamentals/tls-certificate-changes.md).

This includes activity such as the creation of a user in ServiceNow, group in GSuite, or import of a role from AWS. In the future, these events will only be published in the provisioning logs. This change is being implemented to avoid duplicate events across logs, and additional costs incurred by customers consuming the logs in log analytics. 

We'll provide an update when a date is completed. This deprecation isn't planned for the calendar year 2020. 

> [!NOTE]
> This does not impact any events in the audit logs outside of the synchronization events emitted by the provisioning service. Events such as the creation of an application, conditional access policy, a user in the directory, etc. will continue to be emitted in the audit logs. [Learn more](../reports-monitoring/concept-provisioning-logs.md?context=azure%2factive-directory%2fapp-provisioning%2fcontext%2fapp-provisioning-context).

- Automatically address risks by configuring adaptive authentication policies for B2C users. App developers and administrators can mitigate real-time risk by requiring Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or blocking access depending on the user risk level detected, with additional controls available based on location, group, and app.
- Integrate with Azure AD B2C user flows and custom policies. Conditions can be triggered from built-in user flows in Azure AD B2C or can be incorporated into B2C custom policies. As with other aspects of the B2C user flow, end user experience messaging can be customized. Customization is according to the organization's voice, brand, and mitigation alternatives.

### Cloud Provisioning Public Preview Refresh

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Cloud Provisioning 
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
Azure AD Connect Cloud Provisioning public preview refresh features two major enhancements developed from customer feedback: 

- Attribute Mapping Experience through Azure portal

    With this feature, IT Admins can map user, group, or contact attributes from AD to Azure AD using various mapping types present today. Attribute mapping is a feature used for standardizing the values of the attributes that flow from Active Directory to Azure Active Directory. One can determine whether to directly map the attribute value as it is from AD to Azure AD or use expressions to transform the attribute values when provisioning users. [Learn more](../cloud-sync/how-to-attribute-mapping.md)

- On-demand Provisioning or Test User experience

    Once you have set up your configuration, you might want to test to see if the user transformation is working as expected before applying it to all your users in scope. With on-demand provisioning, IT Admins can enter the Distinguished Name (DN) of an AD user and see if they're getting synced as expected. On-demand provisioning provides a great way to ensure that the attribute mappings you did previously work as expected. [Learn More](../cloud-sync/how-to-on-demand-provision.md)

### New delegation role in Azure AD entitlement management: Access package assignment manager

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 
A new Access Package Assignment Manager role has been added in Azure AD entitlement management to provide granular permissions to manage assignments. You can now delegate tasks to a user in this role, who can delegate assignments management of an access package to a business owner. However, an Access Package Assignment Manager can't alter the access package policies or other properties that are set by the administrators. 

With this new role, you benefit from the least privileges needed to delegate management of assignments and maintain administrative control on all other access package configurations. To learn more, see [Entitlement management roles](../governance/entitlement-management-delegate.md#entitlement-management-roles).
 
---

### Changes to Privileged Identity Management's onboarding flow

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Privileged Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Privileged Identity Management
 
Previously, onboarding to Privileged Identity Management (PIM) required user consent and an onboarding flow in PIM's blade that included enrollment in Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). With the recent integration of PIM experience into the Azure AD roles and administrators blade, we are removing this experience. Any tenant with valid P2 license will be auto-onboarded to PIM.

Onboarding to PIM does not have any direct adverse effect on your tenant. You can expect the following changes:
- Additional assignment options such as active vs. eligible with start and end time when you make an assignment in either PIM or Azure AD roles and administrators blade. 
- Additional scoping mechanisms, like Administrative Units and custom roles, introduced directly into the assignment experience. 
- If you're a global administrator or privileged role administrator, you may start getting a few additional emails like the PIM weekly digest. 
- You might also see ms-pim service principal in the audit log related to role assignment. This expected change shouldn't affect your regular workflow.

 For more information, see [Start using Privileged Identity Management](../privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started.md).

### Azure AD Entitlement Management: The Select pane of access package resources now shows by default the resources currently in the selected catalog

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** User Access Management  
**Product capability:** Entitlement Management
 

In the access package creation flow, under the Resource roles tab, the Select pane behavior is changing. Currently, the default behavior is to show all resources that are owned by the user and resources added to the selected catalog. 

This experience will be changed to display only the resources currently added in the catalog by default, so that users can easily pick resources from the catalog. The update will help with discoverability of the resources to add to access packages, and reduce risk of inadvertently adding resources owned by the user that aren't part of the catalog. To learn more, see [Create a new access package in Azure AD entitlement management](../governance/entitlement-management-access-package-create.md#resource-roles).

### As an IT Admin, I want to target client apps using Conditional Access

**Type:** Plan for change   
**Service category:** Conditional Access  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
With the GA release of the client apps condition in Conditional Access, new policies will now apply by default to all client applications. This includes legacy authentication clients. Existing policies will remain unchanged, but the *Configure Yes/No* toggle will be removed from existing policies to easily see which client apps  are applied to by the policy. 

When creating a new policy, make sure to exclude users and service accounts that are still using legacy authentication; if you don't, they'll be blocked. [Learn more](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions.md).

### Upcoming SCIM compliance fixes

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** App Provisioning  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The Azure AD provisioning service uses the SCIM standard for integrating with applications. Our implementation of the SCIM standard is evolving, and we expect to make changes to our behavior around how we perform PATCH operations and set the property "active" on a resource.

### Group owner setting on Azure Admin portal will be changed

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration

Owner settings on Groups general setting page can be configured to restrict owner assignment privileges to a limited group of users in the Azure Admin portal and Access Panel. We'll soon have the ability to assign group owner privilege not only on these two UX portals but also enforce the policy on the backend to provide consistent behavior across endpoints, such as PowerShell and Microsoft Graph. 

We'll start to disable the current setting for the customers who aren't using it and will offer an option to scope users for group owner privilege in the next few months. For guidance on updating group settings, see Edit your group information using [Azure Active Directory](./active-directory-groups-settings-azure-portal.md?context=azure%2factive-directory%2fusers-groups-roles%2fcontext%2fugr-context).

### Windows Hello for Business Sign Ins visible in Azure AD Sign In Logs

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting
 
Windows Hello for Business allows end users to sign into Windows machines with a gesture (such as a PIN or biometric). Azure AD admins may want to differentiate Windows Hello for Business sign-ins from other Windows sign-ins as part of an organization's journey to passwordless authentication. 

Admins can now see whether a Windows authentication used Windows Hello for Business by checking the Authentication Details tab for a Windows sign-in event in the Azure AD sign-ins blade in the Azure portal. Windows Hello for Business authentications will include "WindowsHelloForBusiness" in the Authentication Method field. For more information on interpreting Sign-In Logs, please see the [Sign-In Logs documentation](../reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins.md).

## May 2020

### Retirement of properties in signIns, riskyUsers, and riskDetections APIs

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Identity Protection  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Currently, enumerated types are used to represent the riskType property in both the riskDetections API and riskyUserHistoryItem (in preview). Enumerated types are also used for the riskEventTypes property in the signIns API. Going forward we'll represent these properties as strings. 

Customers should transition to the riskEventType property in the beta riskDetections and riskyUserHistoryItem API, and to riskEventTypes_v2 property in the beta signIns API by September 9th, 2020. At that date, we'll be retiring the current riskType and riskEventTypes properties. For more information, refer to [Changes to risk event properties and Identity Protection APIs on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/changes-to-risk-event-properties-and-identity-protection-apis-on-microsoft-graph/).

### Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

Enumerated types will switch to string types when representing risk event properties in Microsoft Graph September 2020. In addition to impacting the preview APIs, this change will also impact the in-production signIns API.

We have introduced a new riskEventsTypes_v2 (string) property to the signIns v1.0 API. We'll retire the current riskEventTypes (enum) property on June 11, 2022 in accordance with our Microsoft Graph deprecation policy. Customers should transition to the riskEventTypes_v2 property in the v1.0  signIns API by June 11, 2022. For more information, see [Deprecation of riskEventTypes property in signIns v1.0 API on Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/blogs/deprecation-of-riskeventtypes-property-in-signins-v1-0-api-on-microsoft-graph//).

### New self-service sign up for users in federated domains who can't access Microsoft Teams because they aren't synced to Azure Active Directory.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 

Currently, users who are in domains federated in Azure AD, but who aren't synced into the tenant, can't access Teams. Starting at the end of June, this new capability will enable them to do so by extending the existing email verified sign-up feature. This will allow users who can sign in to a federated IdP, but who don't yet have a user object in Azure ID, to have a user object created automatically and be authenticated for Teams. Their user object will be marked as "self-service sign-up." This is an extension of the existing capability to do email verified self-sign up that users in managed domains can do and can be controlled using the same flag. This change will complete rolling out during the following two months. Watch for documentation updates [here](../enterprise-users/directory-self-service-signup.md).

### Upcoming fix: The OIDC discovery document for the Azure Government cloud is being updated to reference the correct Graph endpoints.

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Starting in June, the OIDC discovery document [Microsoft identity platform and OpenID Connect protocol](../develop/v2-protocols-oidc.md) on the [Azure Government cloud](../develop/authentication-national-cloud.md) endpoint (login.microsoftonline.us), will begin to return the correct [National cloud graph](/graph/deployments) endpoint (https://graph.microsoft.us or https://dod-graph.microsoft.us), based on the tenant provided.  It currently provides the incorrect Graph endpoint (graph.microsoft.com) "msgraph_host" field.  

This bug fix will be rolled out gradually over approximately 2 months.  

---

### Azure Government users will no longer be able to sign in on login.microsoftonline.com

**Type:** Plan for Change  
**Service category:** Sovereign Clouds  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
On 1 June 2018, the official Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Authority for Azure Government changed from https://login-us.microsoftonline.com to https://login.microsoftonline.us. If you own an application within an Azure Government tenant, you must update your application to sign users in on the.us endpoint.

Starting May 5th, Azure AD will begin enforcing the endpoint change, blocking Azure Government users from signing into apps hosted in Azure Government tenants using the public endpoint (microsoftonline.com). Impacted apps will begin seeing an error AADSTS900439 - USGClientNotSupportedOnPublicEndpoint. 

There will be a gradual rollout of this change with enforcement expected to be complete across all apps June 2020. For more details, please see the [Azure Government blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azuregov/azure-government-aad-authority-endpoint-update/).

### SAML Single Logout request now sends NameID in the correct format

**Type:** Fixed  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
When a user clicks on sign-out (for example, in the MyApps portal), Azure AD sends a SAML Single Logout message to each app that is active in the user session and has a Logout URL configured. These messages contain a NameID in a persistent format.

If the original SAML sign-in token used a different format for NameID (for example, email/UPN), then the SAML app cannot correlate the NameID in the logout message to an existing session (as the NameIDs used in both messages are different), which caused the logout message to be discarded by the SAML app and the user to stay logged in. This fix makes the sign-out message consistent with the NameID configured for the application.

### The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available

**Type:** Changed Feature   
**Service category:** B2C - Consumer Identity Management  
**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management
 
The new App registrations experience for Azure AD B2C is now generally available. 

Previously, you had to manage your B2C consumer-facing applications separately from the rest of your apps using the legacy 'Applications' experience. That meant different app creation experiences across different places in Azure.

The new experience shows all B2C app registrations and Azure AD app registrations in one place and provides a consistent way to manage them. Whether you need to manage a customer-facing app or an app that has access to Microsoft Graph to programmatically manage Azure AD B2C resources, you only need to learn one way to do things.

You can reach the new experience by navigating the Azure AD B2C service and selecting the App registrations blade. The experience is also accessible from the Azure Active Directory service.

The Azure AD B2C App registrations experience is based on the general [App Registration experience](https://developer.microsoft.com/identity/blogs/new-app-registrations-experience-is-now-generally-available/) for Azure AD tenants but is tailored for Azure AD B2C. The legacy "Applications" experience will be deprecated in the future.

For more information, visit [The New app registration experience for Azure AD B2C](../../active-directory-b2c/app-registrations-training-guide.md).

### Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps now support the latest versions of Workday Web Services API

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** 

Based on customer feedback, we've now updated the Workday inbound user provisioning and writeback apps in the enterprise app gallery to support the latest versions of the Workday Web Services (WWS) API. With this change, customers can specify the WWS API version that they would like to use in the connection string. This gives customers the ability to retrieve more HR attributes available in the releases of Workday. The Workday Writeback app now uses the recommended Change_Work_Contact_Info Workday web service to overcome the limitations of Maintain_Contact_Info.

If no version is specified in the connection string, by default, the Workday inbound provisioning apps will continue to use WWS v21.1  To switch to the latest Workday APIs for inbound user provisioning, customers need to update the connection string as documented [in the tutorial](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md#which-workday-apis-does-the-solution-use-to-query-and-update-workday-worker-profiles) and also update the XPATHs used for Workday attributes as documented in the [Workday attribute reference guide](../app-provisioning/workday-attribute-reference.md#xpath-values-for-workday-web-services-wws-api-v30). 

To use the new API for writeback, there are no changes required in the Workday Writeback provisioning app. On the Workday side, ensure that the Workday Integration System User (ISU) account has permissions to invoke the Change_Work_Contact business process as documented in the tutorial section, [Configure business process security policy permissions](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md#configuring-business-process-security-policy-permissions). 

We have updated our [tutorial guide](../saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial.md) to reflect the new API version support.

### Users with default access role are now in scope for provisioning

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management

Historically, users with the default access role have been out of scope for provisioning. We've heard feedback that customers want users with this role to be in scope for provisioning. As of April 16, 2020, all new provisioning configurations allow users with the default access role to be provisioned. Gradually we'll change the behavior for existing provisioning configurations to support provisioning users with this role. [Learn more.](../app-provisioning/application-provisioning-config-problem-no-users-provisioned.md)

### Updated provisioning UI

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** App Provisioning

**Product capability:** Identity Lifecycle Management

### Dynamic Group rule validation is now available for Public Preview

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** Group Management

**Product capability:** Collaboration

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) now provides the means to validate dynamic group rules. On the **Validate rules** tab, you can validate your dynamic rule against sample group members to confirm the rule is working as expected. When creating or updating dynamic group rules, administrators want to know whether a user or a device will be a member of the group. This helps evaluate whether a user or device meets the rule criteria and aids in troubleshooting when membership is not expected.

For more information, see [Validate a dynamic group membership rule (preview)](../enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-rule-validation.md).

### Identity Secure Score - Security Defaults and multifactor authentication (MFA) improvement action updates

**Type:** Changed feature

**Service category:** N/A

**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

**Supporting security defaults for Azure AD improvement actions:** Microsoft Secure Score will be updating improvement actions to support [security defaults in Azure AD](./concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md), which make it easier to help protect your organization with pre-configured security settings for common attacks. This will affect the following improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multifactor authentication for secure access
- Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative roles
- Enable policy to block legacy authentication
 
**Multifactor authentication (MFA) improvement action updates:** To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score has removed three improvement actions centered around multifactor authentication and added two.

Removed improvement actions:

- Register all users for multifactor authentication
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for Azure AD privileged roles

Added improvement actions:

- Ensure all users can complete multifactor authentication for secure access
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrative roles

These new improvement actions require registering your users or admins for multifactor authentication (MFA) across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. That can take the form of having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions, or setting security defaults (as of March 16th) that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for multifactor authentication (MFA).

### SSPR (self-service password reset) now requires two gates for admins in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) 

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Self-Service Password Reset  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
Previously in Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet), admins using self-service password reset (SSPR) to reset their own passwords needed only one "gate" (challenge) to prove their identity. In public and other national clouds, admins generally must use two gates to prove their identity when using SSPR. But because we didn't support SMS or phone calls in Azure China 21Vianet, we allowed one-gate password reset by admins.

We're creating SSPR feature parity between Azure China 21Vianet and the public cloud. Going forward, admins must use two gates when using SSPR. SMS, phone calls, and Authenticator app notifications and codes will be supported. [Learn more](../authentication/concept-sspr-policy.md#administrator-reset-policy-differences).

### Password length is limited to 256 characters

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
To ensure the reliability of the Azure AD service, user passwords are now limited in length to 256 characters. Users with passwords longer than this will be asked to change their password on subsequent login, either by contacting their admin or by using the self-service password reset feature.

This change was enabled on March 13th, 2020, at 10AM PST (18:00 UTC), and the error is AADSTS 50052, InvalidPasswordExceedsMaxLength. See the [breaking change notice](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#user-passwords-will-be-restricted-to-256-characters) for more details.

**Service category:** Reporting  
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting
 
Starting now, customers who have free tenants can access the [Azure AD sign-in logs from the Azure portal](../reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins.md) for up to 7 days. Previously, sign-in logs were available only for customers with Azure Active Directory Premium licenses. With this change, all tenants can access these logs through the portal.

> [!NOTE]
> Customers still need a premium license (Azure Active Directory Premium P1 or P2) to access the sign-in logs through Microsoft Graph API and Azure Monitor.

### Deprecation of Directory-wide groups option from Groups General Settings on Azure portal

**Type:** Deprecated  
**Service category:** Group Management  
**Product capability:** Collaboration

To provide a more flexible way for customers to create directory-wide groups that best meet their needs, we've replaced the **Directory-wide Groups** option from the **Groups** > **General** settings in the Azure portal with a link to [dynamic group documentation](../enterprise-users/groups-dynamic-membership.md). We've improved our documentation to include more instructions so administrators can create all-user groups that include or exclude guest users.

---

## February 2020

### Upcoming changes to custom controls

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
We're planning to replace the current custom controls preview with an approach that allows partner-provided authentication capabilities to work seamlessly with the Azure Active Directory administrator and end user experiences. Today, partner multifactor authentication (MFA) solutions face the following limitations: they work only after a password has been entered; they don't serve as multifactor authentication (MFA) for step-up authentication in other key scenarios; and they don't integrate with end user or administrative credential management functions. The new implementation will allow partner-provided authentication factors to work alongside built-in factors for key scenarios, including registration, usage, multifactor authentication (MFA) claims, step up authentication, reporting, and logging. 

Custom controls will continue to be supported in preview alongside the new design until it reaches general availability. At that point, we'll give customers time to migrate to the new design. Because of the limitations of the current approach, we won't onboard new providers until the new design is available. We're working closely with customers and providers and will communicate the timeline as we get closer. [Learn more](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/upcoming-changes-to-custom-controls/ba-p/1144696#).

### Identity Secure Score - multifactor authentication (MFA) improvement action updates

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection
 
To reflect the need for businesses to ensure the upmost security while applying policies that work with their business, Microsoft Secure Score is removing three improvement actions centered around multifactor authentication (MFA), and adding two.

The following improvement actions will be removed:

- Register all users for  multifactor authentication (MFA)
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for all users
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for Azure AD privileged roles

The following improvement actions will be added:

- Ensure all users can complete multifactor authentication (MFA) for secure access
- Require multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrative roles

These new improvement actions will require registering your users or admins for multifactor authentication (MFA) across your directory and establishing the right set of policies that fit your organizational needs. The main goal is to have flexibility while ensuring all your users and admins can authenticate with multiple factors or risk-based identity verification prompts. This can take the form of setting security defaults that let Microsoft decide when to challenge users for multifactor authentication (MFA), or having multiple policies that apply scoped decisions. As part of these improvement action updates, Baseline protection policies will no longer be included in scoring calculations.

### Azure AD Domain Services SKU selection

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** Azure AD Domain Services  
**Product capability:** Azure AD Domain Services
 
We've heard feedback that Azure AD Domain Services customers want more flexibility in selecting performance levels for their instances. Starting on February 1, 2020, we switched from a dynamic model (where Azure AD determines the performance and pricing tier based on object count) to a self-selection model. Now customers can choose a performance tier that matches their environment. This change also allows us to enable new scenarios like Resource Forests, and Premium features like daily backups. The object count is now unlimited for all SKUs, but we'll continue to offer object count suggestions for each tier.

**No immediate customer action is required.** For existing customers, the dynamic tier that was in use on February 1, 2020, determines the new default tier. There is no pricing or performance impact as the result of this change. Going forward, Azure AD DS customers will need to evaluate performance requirements as their directory size and workload characteristics change. Switching between service tiers will continue to be a no-downtime operation, and we'll no longer automatically move customers to new tiers based on the growth of their directory. Furthermore, there will be no price increases, and new pricing will align with our current billing model. For more information, see the [Azure AD DS SKUs documentation](../../active-directory-domain-services/administration-concepts.md#azure-ad-ds-skus) and the [Azure AD Domain Services pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory-ds/).

### Breaking Change: URI Fragments will not be carried through the login redirect

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication
 
Starting on February 8, 2020, when a request is sent to login.microsoftonline.com to sign in a user, the service will append an empty fragment to the request.  This prevents a class of redirect attacks by ensuring that the browser wipes out any existing fragment in the request. No application should have a dependency on this behavior. For more information, see [Breaking changes](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#february-2020) in the Microsoft identity platform documentation.

### Replacement of baseline policies with security defaults

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** Other  
**Product capability:** Identity Security and Protection

As part of a secure-by-default model for authentication, we're removing the existing baseline protection policies from all tenants. This removal is targeted for completion at the end of February. The replacement for these baseline protection policies is security defaults. If you've been using baseline protection policies, you must plan to move to the new security defaults policy or to Conditional Access. If you haven't used these policies, there is no action for you to take.

For more information about the new security defaults, see [What are security defaults?](./concept-fundamentals-security-defaults.md) For more information about Conditional Access policies, see [Common Conditional Access policies](../conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common.md).

## November 2019

### Support for the SameSite attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change  
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)  
**Product capability:** User Authentication

As part of a secure-by-default model for cookies, the Chrome 80 browser is changing how it treats cookies without the `SameSite` attribute. Any cookie that doesn't specify the `SameSite` attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`, which will result in Chrome blocking certain cross-domain cookie sharing scenarios that your app may depend on. To maintain the older Chrome behavior, you can use the `SameSite=None` attribute and add an additional `Secure` attribute, so cross-site cookies can only be accessed over HTTPS connections. Chrome is scheduled to complete this change by February 4, 2020.

We recommend all our developers test their apps using this guidance:

- Set the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Set the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

- Add an additional `SameSite` attribute of **Secure**.

For more information, see [Upcoming SameSite Cookie Changes in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/upcoming-samesite-cookie-changes-in-asp-net-and-asp-net-core/) and [Potential disruption to customer websites and Microsoft products and services in Chrome version 79 and later](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4522904/potential-disruption-to-microsoft-services-in-chrome-beta-version-79).

### Application Proxy support for the SameSite Attribute and Chrome 80

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

A couple of weeks prior to the Chrome 80 browser release, we plan to update how Application Proxy cookies treat the **SameSite** attribute. With the release of Chrome 80, any cookie that doesn't specify the **SameSite** attribute will be treated as though it was set to `SameSite=Lax`.

To help avoid potentially negative impacts due to this change, we're updating Application Proxy access and session cookies by:

- Setting the default value for the **Use Secure Cookie** setting to **Yes**.

- Setting the default value for the **SameSite** attribute to **None**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Application Proxy access cookies have always been transmitted exclusively over secure channels. These changes only apply to session cookies.

For more information about the Application Proxy cookie settings, see [Cookie settings for accessing on-premises applications in Azure Active Directory](../app-proxy/application-proxy-configure-cookie-settings.md).

This enhancement helps to reduce your group expiration notifications and helps to make sure that active groups continue to be available. If you already have an active expiration policy for your Office 365 groups, you don't need to do anything to turn on this new functionality.

For more information, see [Configure the expiration policy for Office 365 groups](../enterprise-users/groups-lifecycle.md).

### New Azure AD Global Reader role

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Azure AD roles
**Product capability:** Access Control

Starting on September 24, 2019, we're going to start rolling out a new Azure Active Directory (AD) role called Global Reader. This rollout will start with production and Global cloud customers (GCC), finishing up worldwide in October.

The Global Reader role is the read-only counterpart to Global Administrator. Users in this role can read settings and administrative information across Microsoft 365 services, but can't take management actions. We've created the Global Reader role to help reduce the number of Global Administrators in your organization. Because Global Administrator accounts are powerful and vulnerable to attack, we recommend that you have fewer than five Global Administrators. We recommend using the Global Reader role for planning, audits, or investigations. We also recommend using the Global Reader role in combination with other limited administrator roles, like Exchange Administrator, to help get work done without requiring the Global Administrator role.

The Global Reader role works with the new Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Exchange Admin Center, Teams Admin Center, Security Center, Microsoft Purview compliance portal, Azure portal, and the Device Management Admin Center.

>[!NOTE]
> At the start of public preview, the Global Reader role won't work with: SharePoint, Privileged Access Management, Customer Lockbox, sensitivity labels, Teams Lifecycle, Teams Reporting & Call Analytics, Teams IP Phone Device Management, and Teams App Catalog.

For more information, see [Administrator role permissions in Azure Active Directory](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

### ADAL.NET ignores the MSAL.NET shared cache for on-behalf-of scenarios

**Type:** Fixed
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Starting with Azure AD authentication library (ADAL.NET) version 5.0.0-preview, app developers must [serialize one cache per account for web apps and web APIs](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/wiki/Token-cache-serialization#custom-token-cache-serialization-in-web-applications--web-api). Otherwise, some scenarios using the [on-behalf-of flow](../develop/scenario-web-api-call-api-app-configuration.md?tabs=java) for Java, along with some specific use cases of `UserAssertion`, may result in an elevation of privilege. To avoid this vulnerability, ADAL.NET now ignores the Microsoft Authentication Library for dotnet (MSAL.NET) shared cache for on-behalf-of scenarios.

For more information about this issue, see [Azure Active Directory Authentication Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1258).

## July 2019

### Plan for change: Application Proxy service update to support only TLS 1.2

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** App Proxy
**Product capability:** Access Control

To help provide you with our strongest encryption, we're going to begin limiting Application Proxy service access to only TLS 1.2 protocols. This limitation will initially be rolled out to customers who are already using TLS 1.2 protocols, so you won't see the impact. Complete deprecation of the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols will be complete on August 31, 2019. Customers still using TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will receive advanced notice to prepare for this change.

To maintain the connection to the Application Proxy service throughout this change, we recommend that you make sure your client-server and browser-server combinations are updated to use TLS 1.2. We also recommend that you make sure to include any client systems used by your employees to access apps published through the Application Proxy service.

For more information, see [Add an on-premises application for remote access through Application Proxy in Azure Active Directory](../app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application.md).

### Plan for change: Removal of the multifactor authentication (MFA) server IP address from the Office 365 IP address

**Type:** Plan for change
**Service category:** MFA
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection

We're removing the multifactor authentication (MFA) server IP address from the [Office 365 IP Address and URL Web service](/office365/enterprise/office-365-ip-web-service). If you currently rely on these pages to update your firewall settings, you must make sure you're also including the list of IP addresses documented in the **Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication Server firewall requirements** section of the [Getting started with the Azure Active Directory Multi-Factor Authentication Server](../authentication/howto-mfaserver-deploy.md#azure-multi-factor-authentication-server-firewall-requirements) article.

### App-only tokens now require the client app to exist in the resource tenant

**Type:** Fixed
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

On July 26, 2019, we changed how we provide app-only tokens through the [client credentials grant](../develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow.md). Previously, apps could get tokens to call other apps, regardless of whether the client app was in the tenant. We've updated this behavior so single-tenant resources, sometimes called Web APIs, can only be called by client apps that exist in the resource tenant.

If your app isn't located in the resource tenant, you'll get an error message that says, `The service principal named <app_name> was not found in the tenant named <tenant_name>. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant.` To fix this problem, you must create the client app service principal in the tenant, using either the [admin consent endpoint](../develop/v2-permissions-and-consent.md#using-the-admin-consent-endpoint) or [through PowerShell](../develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell.md), which ensures your tenant has given the app permission to operate within the tenant.

For more information, see [What's new for authentication?](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#app-only-tokens-for-single-tenant-applications-are-only-issued-if-the-client-app-exists-in-the-resource-tenant).

> [!NOTE]
> Existing consent between the client and the API continues to not be required. Apps should still be doing their own authorization checks.

### New B2B direct federation using SAML/WS-Fed (Public Preview)

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** B2B
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C

Direct federation helps to make it easier for you to work with partners whose IT-managed identity solution is not Azure AD, by working with identity systems that support the SAML or WS-Fed standards. After you set up a direct federation relationship with a partner, any new guest user you invite from that domain can collaborate with you using their existing organizational account, making the user experience for your guests more seamless.

For more information, see [Direct federation with AD FS and third-party providers for guest users (preview)](../external-identities/direct-federation.md).

### New check for duplicate group names in the Azure portal

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Group Management
**Product capability:** Collaboration

Now, when you create or update a group name from the Azure portal, we'll perform a check to see if you are duplicating an existing group name in your resource. If we determine that the name is already in use by another group, you'll be asked to modify your name.

For more information, see [Manage groups in the Azure portal](./active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal.md?context=azure%2factive-directory%2fusers-groups-roles%2fcontext%2fugr-context).

### Azure AD now supports static query parameters in reply (redirect) URIs

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Authentications (Logins)
**Product capability:** User Authentication

Azure AD apps can now register and use reply (redirect) URIs with static query parameters (for example, `https://contoso.com/oauth2?idp=microsoft`) for OAuth 2.0 requests. The static query parameter is subject to string matching for reply URIs, just like any other part of the reply URI. If there's no registered string that matches the URL-decoded redirect-uri, the request is rejected. If the reply URI is found, the entire string is used to redirect the user, including the static query parameter.

Dynamic reply URIs are still forbidden because they represent a security risk and can't be used to retain state information across an authentication request. For this purpose, use the `state` parameter.

Currently, the app registration screens of the Azure portal still block query parameters. However, you can manually edit the app manifest to add and test query parameters in your app. For more information, see [What's new for authentication?](../develop/reference-breaking-changes.md#redirect-uris-can-now-contain-query-string-parameters).

### Activity logs (MS Graph APIs) for Azure AD are now available through PowerShell Cmdlets

**Type:** New feature
**Service category:** Reporting
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting

We're excited to announce that Azure AD activity logs (Audit and Sign-ins reports) are now available through the Azure AD PowerShell module. Previously, you could create your own scripts using MS Graph API endpoints, and now we've extended that capability to PowerShell cmdlets.

For more information about how to use these cmdlets, see [Azure AD PowerShell cmdlets for reporting](../reports-monitoring/reference-powershell-reporting.md).

### Updated filter controls for Audit and Sign-in logs in Azure AD

**Type:** Changed feature
**Service category:** Reporting
**Product capability:** Monitoring & Reporting

We've updated the Audit and Sign-in log reports so you can now apply various filters without having to add them as columns on the report screens. Additionally, you can now decide how many filters you want to show on the screen. These updates all work together to make your reports easier to read and more scoped to your needs.

For more information about these updates, see [Filter audit logs](../reports-monitoring/concept-audit-logs.md#filtering-audit-logs) and [Filter sign-in activities](../reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins.md#filter-sign-in-activities).
