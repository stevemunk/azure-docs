### General Availability - Cross-tenant access settings for B2B collaboration

**Type:** Changed feature  
**Service category:** B2B  
**Product capability:** B2B/B2C  

 

Cross-tenant access settings enable you to control how users in your organization collaborate with members of external Azure AD organizations. Now you’ll have granular inbound and outbound access control settings that work on a per org, user, group, and application basis. These settings also make it possible for you to trust security claims from external Azure AD organizations like multi-factor authentication (MFA), device compliance, and hybrid Azure AD joined devices. For more information, see: [Cross-tenant access with Azure AD External Identities](../external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview.md).

**Product capability:** End User Experiences     

 

We've improved the My Sign-ins experience to now support organization switching. Now users who are guests in other tenants can easily switch and sign-in to manage their security info and view activity. More improvements were made to make it easier to switch from My Sign-ins directly to other end user portals such as My Account, My Apps, My Groups, and My Access. For more information, see: [Sign-in logs in Azure Active Directory - preview](../reports-monitoring/concept-all-sign-ins.md)

### General Availability - Temporary Access Pass is now available

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MFA  
**Product capability:** User Authentication  

 

Temporary Access Pass (TAP) is now generally available.

TAP also makes recovery easier when a user has lost or forgotten their strong authentication methods and needs to sign in to register new authentication methods. For more information, see: [Configure Temporary Access Pass in Azure AD to register Passwordless authentication methods](../authentication/howto-authentication-temporary-access-pass.md).

### General Availability - Workload Identity Federation with App Registrations are available now

**Type:** New feature     
**Service category:** Other      
**Product capability:** Developer Experience      

 

Entra Workload Identity Federation allows developers to exchange tokens issued by another identity provider with Azure AD tokens, without needing secrets. It eliminates the need to store, and manage, credentials inside the code or secret stores to access Azure AD protected resources such as Azure and Microsoft Graph. By removing the secrets required to access Azure AD protected resources, workload identity federation can improve the security posture of your organization. This feature also reduces the burden of secret management and minimizes the risk of service downtime due to expired credentials.

For more information on this capability and supported scenarios, see: [Workload identity federation](../develop/workload-identity-federation.md).

###  Public Preview – Protect against by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD

**Type:** New feature  
**Service category:** MS Graph  
**Product capability:** Identity Security & Protection  


We're delighted to announce a new security protection that prevents bypassing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD. When enabled for a federated domain in your Azure AD tenant, it ensures that a compromised federated account can't bypass Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication by imitating that a multi factor authentication has already been performed by the identity provider. The protection can be enabled via new security setting, [federatedIdpMfaBehavior](/graph/api/resources/internaldomainfederation?view=graph-rest-beta#federatedidpmfabehavior-values&preserve-view=true). 

We highly recommend enabling this new protection when using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication as your multi factor authentication for your federated users. To learn more about the protection and how to enable it, visit [Enable protection to prevent by-passing of cloud Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication when federated with Azure AD](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#enable-protection-to-prevent-by-passing-of-cloud-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication-when-federated-with-azure-ad).
