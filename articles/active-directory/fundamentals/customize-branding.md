# Configure your company branding

When users authenticate into your corporate intranet or web-based applications, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides the identity and access management (IAM) service. You can add company branding that applies to all these sign-in experiences to create a consistent experience for your users.

This article covers how to customize the company branding for sign-in experiences for your users. 

An updated experience for adding company branding is available as an Azure AD preview feature. To opt in and explore the new experience, go to **Azure AD** > **Preview features** and enable the **Enhanced Company Branding** feature. Check out the updated documentation on [how to customize branding](how-to-customize-branding.md).

## Role and license requirements

Adding custom branding requires one of the following licenses:

- Azure AD Premium 1
- Azure AD Premium 2
- Office 365 (for Office apps)

At least one of the previously listed licenses is sufficient to add and manage the company branding in your tenant.

Azure AD Premium editions are available for customers in China using the worldwide instance of Azure AD. Azure AD Premium editions aren't currently supported in the Azure service operated by 21Vianet in China. For more information about licensing and editions, see [Sign up for Azure AD Premium](active-directory-get-started-premium.md).

The **Global Administrator** role is required to customize company branding.

## Before you begin

You can customize the sign-in experience when users sign in to your organization by passing a domain variable:
Microsoft 365 Portal: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/?whr=contoso.com`
Outlook: `https://outlook.com/contoso.com`
Teams: `https://teams.microsoft.com/?tenantId=contoso.com`
MyApps: `http://myapps.microsoft.com/?whr=contoso.com`
Azure AD Self-service Password Reset: `https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/?whr=contoso.com`

Custom branding appears after users sign in. Users that start the sign-in process at a site like www\.office.com  won't see the branding. After users sign in, the branding may take at least 15 minutes to appear.

**All branding elements are optional. Default settings will remain, if left unchanged.** For example, if you specify a banner logo but no background image, the sign-in page shows your logo with a default background image from the destination site such as Microsoft 365. Additionally, sign-in page branding doesn't carry over to personal Microsoft accounts. If your users or guests sign in using a personal Microsoft account, the sign-in page won't reflect the branding of your organization.

**Images have different image and file size requirements.** Take note of the requirements for each option. You may need to use a photo editor to create the right-sized images. The preferred image type for all images is PNG, but JPG is accepted. 

**Use Microsoft Graph with Azure AD company branding.** Company branding can be viewed and managed using Microsoft Graph on the `/beta` endpoint and the `organizationalBranding` resource type. For more information, see the [organizational branding API documentation](/graph/api/resources/organizationalbranding?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).

## How to configure company branding

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Company branding** > **Configure**.

3. On the **Configure company branding** page, provide any or all of the following information.

    ![Configure company branding page, with general settings completed](media/customize-branding/legacy-customize-branding-configure-basics.png)

    - **Language** The language for your first customized branding configuration is based on your default locale can't be changed. Once a default sign-in experience is created, you can add language-specific customized branding.
        
    - **Sign-in page background image** Select a PNG or JPG image file to appear as the background for your sign-in pages. The image is anchored to the center of the browser, and scales to the size of the viewable space.
        
        We recommended using images without a strong subject focus. An opaque white box appears in the center of the screen, which could cover any part of the image depending on the dimensions of the viewable space.

    - **Banner logo** Select a PNG or JPG version of your logo to appear on the sign-in page after the user enters a username and on the **My Apps** portal page.
            
        We recommend using a transparent image because the background might not match your logo background. We also recommend not adding padding around the image or it might make your logo look small. 

    - **Username hint** Type the hint text that appears to users if they forget their username. This text must be Unicode, without links or code, and can't exceed 64 characters. If guests sign in to your app, we suggest not adding this hint.

    - **Sign-in page text** Type the text that appears on the bottom of the sign-in page. You can use this text to communicate additional information, such as the phone number to your help desk or a legal statement. This text must be Unicode and can't exceed 1024 characters.

       To begin a new paragraph, use the enter key twice. You can also change text formatting to include bold, italics, an underline or clickable link. Use the following syntax to add formatting to text: 

       > Hyperlink: `[text](link)` 
        
       > Bold: `**text**` or `__text__` 
          
       > Italics: `*text*` or `_text_` 
          
       > Underline: `++text++` 
         
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Hyperlinks that are added to the sign-in page text render as text in native environments, such as desktop and mobile applications.

    - **Advanced settings**
            
    ![Configure company branding page, with advanced settings completed](media/customize-branding/legacy-customize-branding-configure-advanced.png)   

    - **Sign-in page background color** Specify the hexadecimal color (#FFFFFF) that appears in place of your background image in low-bandwidth connection situations. We recommend using the primary color of your banner logo or your organization color.

    - **Square logo image** Select a PNG or JPG image of your organization's logo to appear during the setup process for new Windows 10 Enterprise devices. This image is only used for Windows authentication and only appears on tenants that are using [Windows Autopilot](/windows/deployment/windows-autopilot/windows-10-autopilot) for deployment or password entry pages in other Windows 10 experiences. In some cases, it may also appear in the consent dialog.
        
        We recommend using a transparent image since the background might not match your logo background. We also recommend not adding padding around the image or it might make your logo look small.
    
    - **Square logo image, dark theme** Same as the square logo image. This logo image takes the place of the square logo image when used with a dark background, such as with Windows 10 Azure AD joined screens during the out-of-box experience (OOBE). If your logo looks good on white, dark blue, and black backgrounds, you don't need to add this image. 
        
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > Transparent logos are supported with the square logo image. The color palette used in the transparent logo could conflict with backgrounds (such as, white, light grey, dark grey, and black backgrounds) used within Microsoft 365 apps and services that consume the square logo image. Solid color backgrounds may need to be used to ensure the square image logo is rendered correctly in all situations.
        
    - **Show option to remain signed in** You can choose to let your users remain signed in to Azure AD until explicitly signing out. If you uncheck this option, users must sign in each time the browser is closed and reopened. For more information, see the [Add or update a user's profile](active-directory-users-profile-azure-portal.md#learn-about-the-stay-signed-in-prompt) article.

3. After you've finished adding your branding, select **Save** in the upper-left corner of the configuration panel.

    This process creates your first custom branding configuration, and it becomes the default for your tenant. The default custom branding configuration serves as a fallback option for all language-specific branding configurations. The configuration can't be removed after you create it.
    
    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >To add more corporate branding configurations to your tenant, you must choose **New language** on the **Contoso - Company branding** page. This opens the **Configure company branding** page, where you can follow the previous steps.

## Customize the sign-in experience by browser language

To create an inclusive experience for all of your users, you can customize the sign-in experience based on browser language. You must create a default custom branding experience before you can add a new language.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using a Global administrator account for the directory.

2. Select **Azure Active Directory** > **Company branding** > **+ New language**.

The process for customizing the experience is the same as the main [configure company branding](#configure-your-company-branding) process, except you select a **Language** from the dropdown list.

We recommend adding **Sign-in page text** in the selected language.

## Edit custom branding

If custom branding has been added to your tenant, you can edit the details already provided. Refer to the details and descriptions of each setting in the [configure your company branding](#configure-your-company-branding) section of this article.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using a Global Administrator account for the directory.

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **Company branding**.

1. Select a custom branding item from the list.

1. On the **Edit company branding** page, edit any necessary details.

1. Select **Save**.

   It can take up to an hour for any changes you made to the sign-in page branding to appear.
