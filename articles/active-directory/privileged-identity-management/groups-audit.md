# Audit activity history for group assignments (preview) in Privileged Identity Management

With Privileged Identity Management (PIM), you can view activity, activations, and audit history for group membership or ownership changes done through PIM for groups within your organization in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of Microsoft Entra.

> [!NOTE]
> If your organization has outsourced management functions to a service provider who uses [Azure Lighthouse](../../lighthouse/overview.md), role assignments authorized by that service provider won't be shown here.
