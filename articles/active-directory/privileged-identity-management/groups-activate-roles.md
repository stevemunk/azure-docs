# Activate your group membership or ownership in Privileged Identity Management

In Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of Microsoft Entra, you can use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to have just-in-time membership in the group or just-in-time ownership of the group.

This article is for eligible members or owners who want to activate their group membership or ownership in PIM.

## Activate a role

When you need to take on a group membership or ownership, you can request activation by using the **My roles** navigation option in PIM.

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management -> My roles -> Groups (Preview)**.
    >[!NOTE]
    > You may also use this [short link](https://aka.ms/pim) to open the **My roles** page directly.

1. Using **Eligible assignments** blade, review the list of groups that you have eligible membership or ownership for.

1. Select **Activate** for the eligible assignment you want to activate.

1. Depending on the group’s setting, you may be asked to provide multi-factor authentication or another form of credential.

1. If necessary, specify a custom activation start time. The membership or ownership is to be activated only after the selected time.

1. Depending on the group’s setting, justification for activation may be required. If required, provide it in the **Reason** box.

1.	Select **Activate**.

If the [role requires approval](pim-resource-roles-approval-workflow.md) to activate, an Azure notification appears in the upper right corner of your browser informing you the request is pending approval.

## View the status of your requests

You can view the status of your pending requests to activate. It is specifically important when your requests undergo approval of another person.

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management -> My requests -> Groups (Preview)**. 

1. Review list of requests.

    :::image type="content" source="media/pim-for-groups/pim-group-8.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where to review the list of requests." lightbox="media/pim-for-groups/pim-group-8.png":::


## Cancel a pending request

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management -> My requests -> Groups (Preview)**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/pim-for-groups/pim-group-8.png" alt-text="Screenshot of where to select the request you want to cancel." lightbox="media/pim-for-groups/pim-group-8.png":::

1. For the request that you want to cancel, select **Cancel**.

When you select **Cancel**, the request will be canceled. To activate the role again, you will have to submit a new request for activation.

## Troubleshoot

### Permissions are not granted after activating a role

When you activate a role in PIM, the activation may not instantly propagate to all portals that require the privileged role. Sometimes, even if the change is propagated, web caching in a portal may result in the change not taking effect immediately. If your activation is delayed, here is what you should do.

1. Sign out of the Azure portal and then sign back in.
1. In PIM, verify that you are listed as the member of the role.
