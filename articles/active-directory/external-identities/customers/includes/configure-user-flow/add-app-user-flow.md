Although many applications can be associated with your user flow, a single application can only be associated with one user flow. A user flow allows configuration of the user experience for specific applications. For example, you can configure a user flow that requires users to sign-in or sign-up with a phone number or email address.

1. On the sidebar menu, select **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Select **External Identities**, then **User flows**.
1. Select the self-service sign-up user flow that you created earlier from the list, for example, *SignInSignUpSample*.
1. Under **Use**, select **Applications**.
1. Select **Add application**.

1. Select the application from the list such as *ciam-client-app* or use the search box to find the application, and then select it.

1. Choose **Select**.
