# Common Conditional Access policy: Require multifactor authentication for guest access

Require guest users perform multifactor authentication when accessing your organization's resources.

## User exclusions

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-policy-deploy-template](../../../includes/active-directory-policy-deploy-template.md)]

## Create a Conditional Access policy

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** as a Conditional Access Administrator, Security Administrator, or Global Administrator.
1. Browse to **Azure Active Directory** > **Security** > **Conditional Access**.
1. Select **New policy**.
1. Give your policy a name. We recommend that organizations create a meaningful standard for the names of their policies.
1. Under **Assignments**, select **Users or workload identities**.
   1. Under **Include**, select **All guest and external users**
   1. Under **Exclude**, select **Users and groups** and choose your organization's emergency access or break-glass accounts. 
1. Under **Cloud apps or actions** > **Include**, select **All cloud apps**.
   1. Under **Exclude**, select any applications that don't require multifactor authentication.
1. Under **Access controls** > **Grant**, select **Grant access**, **Require multifactor authentication**, and select **Select**.
1. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **Report-only**.
1. Select **Create** to create to enable your policy.

After confirming your settings using [report-only mode](howto-conditional-access-insights-reporting.md), an administrator can move the **Enable policy** toggle from **Report-only** to **On**.
