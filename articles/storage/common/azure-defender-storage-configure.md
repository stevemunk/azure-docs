# Enable Microsoft Defender for Storage

**Microsoft Defender for Storage** is an Azure-native layer of security intelligence that detects unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit your storage accounts. It uses advanced threat detection capabilities and [Microsoft Threat Intelligence](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2128684) data to provide contextual security alerts. Those alerts also include steps to mitigate the detected threats and prevent future attacks.

Microsoft Defender for Storage continuously analyzes the transactions of [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs/), [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/data-lake-storage/), and [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/) services. When potentially malicious activities are detected, security alerts are generated. Alerts are shown in Microsoft Defender for Cloud with the details of the suspicious activity, appropriate investigation steps, remediation actions, and security recommendations.

Analyzed transactions of Azure Blob Storage include operation types such as `Get Blob`, `Put Blob`, `Get Container ACL`, `List Blobs`, and `Get Blob Properties`. Examples of analyzed Azure Files operation types include `Get File`, `Create File`, `List Files`, `Get File Properties`, and `Put Range`.

**Defender for Storage doesn't access the Storage account data, doesn't require you to enable access logs, and has no impact on Storage performance.**

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Defender for Storage customers can now choose to move to a new predictable pricing plan. The pricing model is per-storage account, where high-volume transactions may incur additional overage charges. This new pricing plan will also include all new security features and detections.
>
> Customers using the legacy per-transaction pricing plan need to migrate to the new per-storage account plan to access these new features and pricing. The legacy per-transaction pricing plan charges are based on the number of analyzed transactions in the storage account.
>
> For further details, please refer to the [Microsoft Defender for Storage FAQ](#faq---microsoft-defender-for-storage-pricing).

## Set up Microsoft Defender for Storage

## [Per-storage account pricing](#tab/per-storage-account/)

> [!NOTE]
> You can only enable per-storage account pricing at the subscription level.

With the Defender for Storage per-storage account pricing, you can configure Defender for Storage on your subscriptions in several ways to protect all your existing and new storage accounts in that subscription.

You can configure Microsoft Defender for Storage on your subscriptions in several ways:

- [Azure portal](#azure-portal)
- [Bicep template](#bicep-template)
- [ARM template](#arm-template)
- [Terraform template](#terraform-template)
- [REST API](#rest-api)

### Azure portal

## FAQ - Microsoft Defender for Storage pricing
### Can I switch from an existing per-transaction pricing to per-storage account pricing?

Yes, you can migrate to per-storage account pricing in the Azure portal or using any of the other supported enablement methods. To migrate to per-storage account pricing, [enable per-storage account pricing at the subscription level](#set-up-microsoft-defender-for-storage).

### Can I return to per-transaction pricing after switching to per-storage account pricing?

Yes, you can [enable per-transaction pricing](#set-up-microsoft-defender-for-storage) to migrate back from per-storage account pricing using all enablement methods except for the Azure portal.

### Will you continue supporting per-transaction pricing?

Yes, you can [enable per-transaction pricing](#set-up-microsoft-defender-for-storage) from all the enablement methods, except for the Azure portal.

### Can I exclude specific storage accounts from protections in per-storage account pricing?

No, you can only enable per-storage account pricing for each subscription. All storage accounts in the subscription are protected.
