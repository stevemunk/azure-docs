# Troubleshoot Azure File Sync cloud tiering

Cloud tiering, an optional feature of Azure File Sync, decreases the amount of local storage required while keeping the performance of an on-premises file server. When enabled, this feature stores only frequently accessed (hot) files on your local server. Infrequently accessed (cool) files are split into namespace (file and folder structure) and file content. 

There are two paths for failures in cloud tiering:

- Files can fail to tier, which means that Azure File Sync unsuccessfully attempts to tier a file to Azure Files.
- Files can fail to recall, which means that the Azure File Sync file system filter (StorageSync.sys) fails to download data when a user attempts to access a file that has been tiered.

There are two main classes of failures that can happen via either failure path:

- Cloud storage failures
    - *Transient storage service availability issues*. For more information, see the [Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/storage/v1_5/).
    - *Inaccessible Azure file share*. This failure typically happens when you delete the Azure file share when it is still a cloud endpoint in a sync group.
    - *Inaccessible storage account*. This failure typically happens when you delete the storage account while it still has an Azure file share that is a cloud endpoint in a sync group. 
- Server failures 
  - *Azure File Sync file system filter (StorageSync.sys) is not loaded*. In order to respond to tiering/recall requests, the Azure File Sync file system filter must be loaded. The filter not being loaded can happen for several reasons, but the most common reason is that an administrator unloaded it manually. The Azure File Sync file system filter must be loaded at all times for Azure File Sync to properly function.
  - *Missing, corrupt, or otherwise broken reparse point*. A reparse point is a special data structure on a file that consists of two parts:
    1. A reparse tag, which indicates to the operating system that the Azure File Sync file system filter (StorageSync.sys) may need to do some action on IO to the file. 
    2. Reparse data, which indicates to the file system filter the URI of the file on the associated cloud endpoint (the Azure file share). 
        
       The most common way a reparse point could become corrupted is if an administrator attempts to modify either the tag or its data. 
  - *Network connectivity issues*. In order to tier or recall a file, the server must have internet connectivity.

The following sections indicate how to troubleshoot cloud tiering issues and determine if an issue is a cloud storage issue or a server issue.

## How to monitor tiering activity on a server  
To monitor tiering activity on a server, use Event ID 9003, 9016 and 9029 in the Telemetry event log (located under Applications and Services\Microsoft\FileSync\Agent in Event Viewer).

- Event ID 9003 provides error distribution for a server endpoint. For example, Total Error Count, ErrorCode, etc. Note, one event is logged per error code.
- Event ID 9016 provides ghosting results for a volume. For example, Free space percent is, Number of files ghosted in session, Number of files failed to ghost, etc.
- Event ID 9029 provides ghosting session information for a server endpoint. For example, Number of files attempted in the session, Number of files tiered in the session, Number of files already tiered, etc.

## How to monitor recall activity on a server
To monitor recall activity on a server, use Event ID 9005, 9006, 9009 and 9059 in the Telemetry event log (located under Applications and Services\Microsoft\FileSync\Agent in Event Viewer).

- Event ID 9005 provides recall reliability for a server endpoint. For example, Total unique files accessed, Total unique files with failed access, etc.
- Event ID 9006 provides recall error distribution for a server endpoint. For example, Total Failed Requests, ErrorCode, etc. Note, one event is logged per error code.
- Event ID 9009 provides recall session information for a server endpoint. For example, DurationSeconds, CountFilesRecallSucceeded, CountFilesRecallFailed, etc.
- Event ID 9059 provides application recall distribution for a server endpoint. For example, ShareId, Application Name, and TotalEgressNetworkBytes.

## How to troubleshoot files that fail to tier
If files fail to tier to Azure Files:

1. In Event Viewer, review the telemetry, operational and diagnostic event logs, located under Applications and Services\Microsoft\FileSync\Agent. 
   1. Verify the files exist in the Azure file share.

      > [!NOTE]
      > A file must be synced to an Azure file share before it can be tiered.

   2. Verify the server has internet connectivity. 
   3. Verify the Azure File Sync filter drivers (StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys) are running:
       - At an elevated command prompt, run `fltmc`. Verify that the StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys file system filter drivers are listed.

> [!NOTE]
> An Event ID 9003 is logged once an hour in the Telemetry event log if a file fails to tier (one event is logged per error code). Check the [Tiering errors and remediation](#tiering-errors-and-remediation) section to see if remediation steps are listed for the error code.

## How to troubleshoot files that fail to be recalled  
If files fail to be recalled:
1. In Event Viewer, review the telemetry, operational and diagnostic event logs, located under Applications and Services\Microsoft\FileSync\Agent.
    1. Verify the files exist in the Azure file share.
    2. Verify the server has internet connectivity. 
    3. Open the Services MMC snap-in and verify the Storage Sync Agent service (FileSyncSvc) is running.
    4. Verify the Azure File Sync filter drivers (StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys) are running:
        - At an elevated command prompt, run `fltmc`. Verify that the StorageSync.sys and StorageSyncGuard.sys file system filter drivers are listed.

> [!NOTE]
> An Event ID 9006 is logged once per hour in the Telemetry event log if a file fails to recall (one event is logged per error code). Check the [Recall errors and remediation](#recall-errors-and-remediation) section to see if remediation steps are listed for the error code.

## Recall errors and remediation

| HRESULT | HRESULT (decimal) | Error string | Issue | Remediation |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| 0x80070079 | -2147942521 | ERROR_SEM_TIMEOUT | The file failed to recall due to an I/O timeout. This issue can occur for several reasons: server resource constraints, poor network connectivity or an Azure storage issue (for example, throttling). | No action required. If the error persists for several hours, please open a support case. |
| 0x80070036 | -2147024842 | ERROR_NETWORK_BUSY | The file failed to recall due to a network issue.  | If the error persists, check network connectivity to the Azure file share. |
| 0x80c80037 | -2134376393 | ECS_E_SYNC_SHARE_NOT_FOUND | The file failed to recall because the server endpoint was deleted. | To resolve this issue, see [Tiered files are not accessible on the server after deleting a server endpoint](?tabs=portal1%252cazure-portal#tiered-files-are-not-accessible-on-the-server-after-deleting-a-server-endpoint). |
| 0x80070005 | -2147024891 | ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED | The file failed to recall due to an access denied error. This issue can occur if the firewall and virtual network settings on the storage account are enabled and the server does not have access to the storage account. | To resolve this issue, add the Server IP address or virtual network by following the steps documented in the [Configure firewall and virtual network settings](file-sync-deployment-guide.md?tabs=azure-portal#optional-configure-firewall-and-virtual-network-settings) section in the deployment guide. |
| 0x80c86002 | -2134351870 | ECS_E_AZURE_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND | The file failed to recall because it's not accessible in the Azure file share. | To resolve this issue, verify the file exists in the Azure file share.

| 0x80c86047 | -2134351801 | ECS_E_AZURE_SHARE_SNAPSHOT_NOT_FOUND | The file failed to recall because it's referencing a version of the file which no longer exists in the Azure file share. | This issue can occur if the tiered file was restored from a backup of the Windows Server. To resolve this issue, restore the file from a snapshot in the Azure file share. |

## Tiered files are not accessible on the server after deleting a server endpoint
Tiered files on a server will become inaccessible if the files are not recalled prior to deleting a server endpoint.

Errors logged if tiered files are not accessible
- When syncing a file, error code -2147942467 (0x80070043 - ERROR_BAD_NET_NAME) is logged in the ItemResults event log
- When recalling a file, error code -2134376393 (0x80c80037 - ECS_E_SYNC_SHARE_NOT_FOUND) is logged in the RecallResults event log

Restoring access to your tiered files is possible if the following conditions are met:
- Server endpoint was deleted within past 30 days
- Cloud endpoint was not deleted 
- File share was not deleted
- Sync group was not deleted

If the above conditions are met, you can restore access to the files on the server by recreating the server endpoint at the same path on the server within the same sync group within 30 days. 

If the above conditions are not met, restoring access is not possible as these tiered files on the server are now orphaned. Follow the instructions below to remove the orphaned tiered files.

**Notes**
- When tiered files are not accessible on the server, the full file should still be accessible if you access the Azure file share directly.
- To prevent orphaned tiered files in the future, follow the steps documented in [Remove a server endpoint](file-sync-server-endpoint-delete.md) when deleting a server endpoint.

<a id="get-orphaned"></a>**How to get the list of orphaned tiered files** 

1. Run the following PowerShell commands to list orphaned tiered files:
```powershell
Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\StorageSync.Management.ServerCmdlets.dll"
$orphanFiles = Get-StorageSyncOrphanedTieredFiles -path <server endpoint path>
$orphanFiles.OrphanedTieredFiles > OrphanTieredFiles.txt
```
2. Save the OrphanTieredFiles.txt output file in case files need to be restored from backup after they are deleted.

<a id="remove-orphaned"></a>**How to remove orphaned tiered files** 

*Option 1: Delete the orphaned tiered files*

This option deletes the orphaned tiered files on the Windows Server but requires removing the server endpoint if it exists due to recreation after 30 days or is connected to a different sync group. File conflicts will occur if files are updated on the Windows Server or Azure file share before the server endpoint is recreated.

1. Back up the Azure file share and server endpoint location.
2. Remove the server endpoint in the sync group (if exists) by following the steps documented in [Remove a server endpoint](file-sync-server-endpoint-delete.md).

> [!Warning]  
> If the server endpoint is not removed prior to using the Remove-StorageSyncOrphanedTieredFiles cmdlet, deleting the orphaned tiered file on the server will delete the full file in the Azure file share. 

3. Run the following PowerShell commands to list orphaned tiered files:

```powershell
Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\StorageSync.Management.ServerCmdlets.dll"
$orphanFiles = Get-StorageSyncOrphanedTieredFiles -path <server endpoint path>
$orphanFiles.OrphanedTieredFiles > OrphanTieredFiles.txt
```
4. Save the OrphanTieredFiles.txt output file in case files need to be restored from backup after they are deleted.
5. Run the following PowerShell commands to delete orphaned tiered files:

```powershell
Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\StorageSync.Management.ServerCmdlets.dll"
$orphanFilesRemoved = Remove-StorageSyncOrphanedTieredFiles -Path <folder path containing orphaned tiered files> -Verbose
$orphanFilesRemoved.OrphanedTieredFiles > DeletedOrphanFiles.txt
```
**Notes** 
- Tiered files modified on the server that are not synced to the Azure file share will be deleted.
- Tiered files that are accessible (not orphan) will not be deleted.
- Non-tiered files will remain on the server.

6. Optional: Recreate the server endpoint if deleted in step 3.

*Option 2: Mount the Azure file share and copy the files locally that are orphaned on the server*

This option doesn't require removing the server endpoint but requires sufficient disk space to copy the full files locally.

1. [Mount](../files/storage-how-to-use-files-windows.md?toc=/azure/storage/filesync/toc.json) the Azure file share on the Windows Server that has orphaned tiered files.
2. Run the following PowerShell commands to list orphaned tiered files:
```powershell
Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\StorageSync.Management.ServerCmdlets.dll"
$orphanFiles = Get-StorageSyncOrphanedTieredFiles -path <server endpoint path>
$orphanFiles.OrphanedTieredFiles > OrphanTieredFiles.txt
```
3. Use the OrphanTieredFiles.txt output file to identify orphaned tiered files on the server.
4. Overwrite the orphaned tiered files by copying the full file from the Azure file share to the Windows Server.

## How to troubleshoot files unexpectedly recalled on a server  
Antivirus, backup, and other applications that read large numbers of files cause unintended recalls unless they respect the skip offline attribute and skip reading the content of those files. Skipping offline files for products that support this option helps avoid unintended recalls during operations like antivirus scans or backup jobs.

Consult with your software vendor to learn how to configure their solution to skip reading offline files.

Unintended recalls also might occur in other scenarios, like when you are browsing cloud-tiered files in File Explorer. This is likely to occur on Windows Server 2016 if the folder contains executable files. File Explorer was improved for Windows Server 2019 and later to better handle offline files.

> [!NOTE]
>Use Event ID 9059 in the Telemetry event log to determine which application(s) is causing recalls. This event provides application recall distribution for a server endpoint and is logged once an hour.

## Process exclusions for Azure File Sync

If you want to configure your antivirus or other applications to skip scanning for files accessed by Azure File Sync, configure the following process exclusions:

- C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\AfsAutoUpdater.exe
- C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\FileSyncSvc.exe
- C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\MAAgent\MonAgentLauncher.exe
- C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\MAAgent\MonAgentHost.exe
- C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\MAAgent\MonAgentManager.exe
- C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\MAAgent\MonAgentCore.exe
- C:\Program Files\Azure\StorageSyncAgent\MAAgent\Extensions\XSyncMonitoringExtension\AzureStorageSyncMonitor.exe

## TLS 1.2 required for Azure File Sync

You can view the TLS settings at your server by looking at the [registry settings](/windows-server/security/tls/tls-registry-settings). 

If you're using a proxy, consult your proxy's documentation and ensure it is configured to use TLS 1.2.
