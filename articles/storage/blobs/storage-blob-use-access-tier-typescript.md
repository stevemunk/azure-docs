# Using access tiers with TypeScript

This article shows how to use [access tiers](access-tiers-overview.md) for block blobs with the [Azure Storage client library for JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/storage-blob). 

## Understand block blob access tiers

Data stored in the cloud grows at an exponential pace. To manage costs for your expanding storage needs, it can be helpful to organize your data based on how frequently it will be accessed and how long it will be retained. Azure storage offers different access tiers so that you can store your blob data in the most cost-effective manner based on how it's being used. Azure Storage access tiers include:

- [**Online tiers**](access-tiers-overview.md#online-access-tiers)
    - **Hot tier** - An online tier optimized for storing data that is accessed or modified frequently. The hot tier has the highest storage costs, but the lowest access costs.
    - **Cool tier** - An online tier optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified. Data in the cool tier should be stored for a minimum of 30 days. The cool tier has lower storage costs and higher access costs compared to the hot tier.
- [**Archive tier**](access-tiers-overview.md#archive-access-tier) - An offline tier optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed, and that has flexible latency requirements, on the order of hours. Data in the archive tier should be stored for a minimum of 180 days.

## Restrictions

Setting the access tier is only allowed on block blobs. To learn more about restrictions on setting a block blob's access tier, see [Set Blob Tier (REST API)](/rest/api/storageservices/set-blob-tier#remarks).

## Set a blob's access tier during upload

To [upload](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blockblobclient#@azure-storage-blob-blockblobclient-upload) a blob into a specific access tier, use the [BlockBlobUploadOptions](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blockblobuploadoptions). The `tier` property choices are: `Hot`, `Cool`, or `Archive`.

## Change a blob's access tier after upload

To change the access tier of a blob after it's uploaded to storage, use [setAccessTier](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blockblobclient#@azure-storage-blob-blockblobclient-setaccesstier). Along with the tier, you can set the [BlobSetTierOptions](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blobsettieroptions) property [rehydration priority](archive-rehydrate-overview.md) to bring the block blob out of an archived state. Possible values are `High` or `Standard`.

## Copy a blob into a different access tier

Use the BlobClient.[beginCopyFromURL](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blobclient#@azure-storage-blob-blobclient-begincopyfromurl) method to copy a blob. To change the access tier during the copy operation, use the [BlobBeginCopyFromURLOptions](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blobbegincopyfromurloptions) `tier` property and specify a different access [tier](storage-blob-storage-tiers.md) than the source blob.

## Use a batch to change access tier for many blobs

The batch represents an aggregated set of operations on blobs, such as [delete](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blobbatchclient#@azure-storage-blob-blobbatchclient-deleteblobs-1) or [set access tier](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blobbatchclient#@azure-storage-blob-blobbatchclient-setblobsaccesstier-1). You need to pass in the correct credential to successfully perform each operation. In this example, the same credential is used for a set of blobs in the same container. 

Create a [BlobBatchClient](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blobbatchclient). Use the client to create a batch with the [createBatch()](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blobbatchclient#@azure-storage-blob-blobbatchclient-createbatch) method. When the batch is ready, [submit](/javascript/api/@azure/storage-blob/blobbatchclient#@azure-storage-blob-blobbatchclient-submitbatch) the batch for processing. Use the returned structure to validate each blob's operation was successful.
