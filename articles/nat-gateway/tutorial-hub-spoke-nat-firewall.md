# Tutorial: Integrate NAT gateway with Azure Firewall in a hub and spoke network for outbound connectivity

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to integrate a NAT gateway with an Azure Firewall in a hub and spoke network

Azure Firewall provides [2,496 SNAT ports per public IP address](../firewall/integrate-with-nat-gateway.md) configured per backend Virtual Machine Scale Set instance (minimum of two instances). You can associate up to 250 public IP addresses to Azure Firewall. Depending on your architecture requirements and traffic patterns, you may require more SNAT ports than what Azure Firewall can provide. You may also require the use of fewer public IPs while also requiring more SNAT ports. A better method for outbound connectivity is to use NAT gateway. NAT gateway provides 64,512 SNAT ports per public IP address and can be used with up to 16 public IP addresses. 

NAT gateway can be integrated with Azure Firewall by configuring NAT gateway directly to the Azure Firewall subnet in order to provide a more scalable method of outbound connectivity. For production deployments, a hub and spoke network is recommended, where the firewall is in its own virtual network. The workload servers are peered virtual networks in the same region as the hub virtual network where the firewall resides. In this architectural setup, NAT gateway can provide outbound connectivity from the hub virtual network for all spoke virtual networks peered.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a hub virtual network and deploy an Azure Firewall and Azure Bastion during deployment
> * Create a NAT gateway and associate it with the firewall subnet in the hub virtual network
> * Create a spoke virtual network
> * Create a virtual network peering
> * Create a route table for the spoke virtual network
> * Create a firewall policy for the hub virtual network
> * Create a virtual machine to test the outbound connectivity through the NAT gateway

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 

## Create the hub virtual network

The hub virtual network contains the firewall subnet that is associated with the Azure Firewall and NAT gateway. Use the following example to create the hub virtual network.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)

2. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual network**. Select **Virtual networks** in the search results.

3. Select **+ Create**.

4. In the **Basics** tab of **Create virtual network**, enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | **Project details** |   |
    | Subscription | Select your subscription. |
    | Resource group | Select **Create new**. </br> Enter **TutorialNATHubSpokeFW-rg**. </br> Select **OK**. |
    | **Instance details** |   |
    | Name | Enter **myVNet-Hub**. |
    | Region | Select **South Central US**. |

5. Select **Next: IP Addresses**.

6. In the **IP Addresses** tab in **IPv4 address space**, select the trash can to delete the address space that is auto populated.

7. In **IPv4 address space** enter **10.1.0.0/16**.

8. Select **+ Add subnet**.

9. In **Add subnet** enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Subnet name | Enter **subnet-private**. |
    | Subnet address range | Enter **10.1.0.0/24**. |

10. Select **Add**.

11. Select **Next: Security**.

12. In the **Security** tab in **BastionHost**, select **Enable**.

13. Enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Bastion name | Enter **myBastion**. |
    | AzureBastionSubnet address space | Enter **10.1.1.0/26**. |
    | Public IP address | Select **Create new**. </br> In **Name** enter **myPublicIP-Bastion**. </br> Select **OK**. |

14. In **Firewall** select **Enable**.

15. Enter or select the following information:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Firewall name | Enter **myFirewall**. |
    | Firewall subnet address space | Enter **10.1.2.0/26**. |
