# Share images using a community gallery (preview)

To share a gallery with all Azure users, you can create a [community gallery (preview)](azure-compute-gallery.md#community-gallery). Community galleries can be used by anyone with an Azure subscription. Someone creating a VM can browse images shared with the community using the portal, REST, or the Azure CLI.

Sharing images to the community is a new capability in [Azure Compute Gallery](./azure-compute-gallery.md#community). In the preview, you can make your image galleries public, and share them to all Azure customers. When a gallery is marked as a community gallery, all images under the gallery become available to all Azure customers as a new resource type under Microsoft.Compute/communityGalleries. All Azure customers can see the galleries and use them to create VMs. Your original resources of the type `Microsoft.Compute/galleries` are still under your subscription, and private.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Compute Gallery – community galleries is currently in PREVIEW and subject to the [Preview Terms for Azure Compute Gallery - community gallery](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).
> 
> To publish a community gallery, you need to register for the preview at [https://aka.ms/communitygallery-preview](https://aka.ms/communitygallery-preview). It will take up to 10 business days after submitting the form to approve the feature. Creating VMs from the community gallery is open to all Azure users.
> 
> During the preview, the gallery must be created as a community gallery (for CLI, this means using the `--permissions community` parameter) you currently can't migrate a regular gallery to a community gallery.
> 
> You can't currently create a Flexible virtual machine scale set from an image shared by another tenant.


There are three main ways to share images in an Azure Compute Gallery, depending on who you want to share with:

| Sharing with: | People | Groups | Service Principal | All users in a specific   subscription (or) tenant | Publicly with all users in   Azure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [RBAC Sharing](share-gallery.md) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| RBAC + [Direct shared gallery](./share-gallery-direct.md)  | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| RBAC + [Community gallery](./share-gallery-community.md) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |

## Limitations for images shared to the community

There are some limitations for sharing your gallery to the community:
- Encrypted images aren't supported.
- TrustedLaunch and TVMSupported Image is not supported
- CVMSuppored image is not supported
- For the preview, image resources need to be created in the same region as the gallery. For example, if you create a gallery in West US, the image definitions and image versions should be created in West US if you want to make them available during the public preview.
- For the preview, you can't share [VM Applications](vm-applications.md) to the community.
- The gallery must be created as a community gallery. For the preview, there is no way to migrate an existing private gallery to be a community gallery
- The image version region in the gallery should be same as the region home region, creating of cross-region version where the home region is different than the gallery is not supported, however once the image is in the home region it can be replicated to other regions
- To find images shared to the community from the Azure portal, you need to go through the VM create or scale set creation pages. You can't search the portal or Azure Marketplace for the images

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft does not provide support for images you share to the community.

## How sharing with the community works

You [create a gallery resource](create-gallery.md#create-a-community-gallery) under `Microsoft.Compute/Galleries` and choose `community` as a sharing option.

When you are ready, you flag your gallery as ready to be shared publicly. Only the  owner of a subscription, or a user or service principal with the `Compute Gallery Sharing Admin` role at the subscription or gallery level, can enable a gallery to go public to the community. At this point, the Azure infrastructure creates proxy read-only regional resources, under `Microsoft.Compute/CommunityGalleries`, which are public.

The end-users can only interact with the proxy resources, they never interact with your private resources. As the publisher of the private resource, you should consider the private resource as your handle to the public proxy resources. The `prefix` you provide when you create the gallery will be used, along with a unique GUID, to create the public facing name for your gallery.

Azure users can see the latest image versions shared to the community in the portal, or query for them using the CLI. Only the latest version of an image is listed in the community gallery.

When creating a community gallery, you will need to provide contact information for your images. This information will be shown **publicly**, so be careful when providing it:
- Community gallery prefix
- Publisher support email
- Publisher URL
- Legal agreement URL

Information from your image definitions will also be publicly available, like what you provide for **Publisher**, **Offer**, and **SKU**.

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to stop sharing a gallery publicly, you can update the gallery to stop sharing, but making the gallery private will prevent existing virtual machine scale set users from scaling their resources.
>
> If you stop sharing your gallery during the preview, you won't be able to re-share it.

## Start sharing publicly

In order to share a gallery publicly, it needs to be created as a community gallery. For more information, see [Create a community gallery](create-gallery.md#create-a-community-gallery)

### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Once you are ready to make the gallery available to the public, enable the community gallery using [az sig share enable-community](/cli/azure/sig/share#az-sig-share-enable-community). Only a user in the `Owner` role definition can enable a gallery for community sharing.

```azurecli-interactive
az sig share enable-community \
   --gallery-name $galleryName \
   --resource-group $resourceGroup 
```


To go back to only RBAC based sharing, use the [az sig share reset](/cli/azure/sig/share#az-sig-share-reset) command.

To delete a gallery shared to community, you must first run `az sig share reset` to stop sharing, then delete the gallery.

### [REST](#tab/rest)

To go live with community sharing, send the following POST request. As part of the request, include the property `operationType` with value `EnableCommunity`.  

```rest
POST 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/providers/Microsoft.Compu 
te/galleries/{galleryName}/share?api-version=2021-07-01 
{ 
  "operationType" : "EnableCommunity"
} 
```

### [Portal](#tab/portal)

When you're ready to make the gallery public:

1. On the page for the gallery, select **Sharing** from the left menu.
1. Select **Share** from the top of the page.
   :::image type="content" source="media/create-gallery/share.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Share button for sharing your gallery to the community.":::
1. When you are done, select **Save**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are listed as the owner of your subscription, but you are having trouble sharing the gallery publicly, you may need to explicitly [add yourself as owner again](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-subscription-admin.md).

To go back to only RBAC based sharing, use the [az sig share reset](/cli/azure/sig/share#az-sig-share-reset) command.

To delete a gallery shared to community, you must first run `az sig share reset` to stop sharing, then delete the gallery.

## Next steps

Create an [image definition and an image version](image-version.md).

Create a VM from a [generalized](vm-generalized-image-version.md#community-gallery) or [specialized](vm-specialized-image-version.md#community-gallery) image in a community gallery.
