# Use Application Configuration Service for Tanzu

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Spring Apps is the new name for the Azure Spring Cloud service. Although the service has a new name, you'll see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams.

**This article applies to:** ❌ Basic/Standard ✔️ Enterprise

This article shows you how to use Application Configuration Service for VMware Tanzu® with the Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan.

[Application Configuration Service for VMware Tanzu](https://docs.pivotal.io/tcs-k8s/0-1/) is one of the commercial VMware Tanzu components. It enables the management of Kubernetes-native `ConfigMap` resources that are populated from properties defined in one or more Git repositories.

With Application Configuration Service for Tanzu, you have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments. To understand the differences from Spring Cloud Config Server in Basic/Standard, see the [Use Application Configuration Service for external configuration](./how-to-migrate-standard-tier-to-enterprise-tier.md#use-application-configuration-service-for-external-configuration) section of [Migrate an Azure Spring Apps Basic or Standard plan instance to the Enterprise plan](./how-to-migrate-standard-tier-to-enterprise-tier.md).

## Prerequisites

- An already provisioned Azure Spring Apps Enterprise tiplaner instance with Application Configuration Service for Tanzu enabled. For more information, see [Quickstart: Build and deploy apps to Azure Spring Apps using the Enterprise plan](quickstart-deploy-apps-enterprise.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > To use Application Configuration Service for Tanzu, you must enable it when you provision your Azure Spring Apps service instance. You can't enable it after you provision the instance.

## Manage Application Configuration Service for Tanzu settings

Application Configuration Service for Tanzu supports Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket for storing your configuration files.

To manage the service settings, open the **Settings** section and add a new entry under the **Repositories** section.

| `Patterns`    | Yes       | Patterns to search in Git repositories. For each pattern, use a format such as *{application}* or *{application}/{profile}* rather than *{application}-{profile}.yml*. Separate the patterns with commas. For more information, see the [Pattern](./how-to-enterprise-application-configuration-service.md#pattern) section of this article. |
| `URI`         | Yes       | A Git URI (for example, `https://github.com/Azure-Samples/piggymetrics-config` or `git@github.com:Azure-Samples/piggymetrics-config`)                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Label`       | Yes       | The branch name to search in the Git repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Search path` | No        | Optional search paths, separated by commas, for searching subdirectories of the Git repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Pattern

Configuration is pulled from Git backends using what you define in a pattern. A pattern is a combination of *{application}/{profile}* as described in the following guidelines.

- *{application}* - The name of an application whose configuration you're retrieving. The value `application` is considered the default application and includes configuration information shared across multiple applications. Any other value refers to a specific application and includes properties for both the specific application and shared properties for the default application.
- *{profile}* - Optional. The name of a profile whose properties you may be retrieving. An empty value, or the value `default`, includes properties that are shared across profiles. Non-default values include properties for the specified profile and properties for the default profile.

### Authentication

The following image shows the three types of repository authentication supported by Application Configuration Service for Tanzu.

- Public repository.

   You don't need extra Authentication configuration when you use a public repository. Select **Public** in the **Authentication** form.

- Private repository with basic authentication.

   The following table shows the configurable properties you can use to set up a private Git repository with basic authentication.

   | Property   | Required? | Description                                 |
   |------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
   | `username` | Yes       | The username used to access the repository. |
   | `password` | Yes       | The password used to access the repository. |

- Private repository with SSH authentication.

   The following table shows the configurable properties you can use to set up a private Git repository with SSH.

   | Property                   | Required? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   |----------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `Private key`              | Yes       | The private key that identifies the Git user. Passphrase-encrypted private keys aren't supported.                                                                                                                                   |
   | `Host key`                 | No        | The host key of the Git server. If you've connected to the server via Git on the command line, the host key is in your *.ssh/known_hosts* file. Don't include the algorithm prefix, because it's specified in `Host key algorithm`. |
   | `Host key algorithm`       | No        | The algorithm for `hostKey`: one of `ssh-dss`, `ssh-rsa`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`. (Required if supplying `Host key`).                                                              |
   | `Strict host key checking` | No        | Optional value that indicates whether the backend should be ignored if it encounters an error when using the provided `Host key`. Valid values are `true` and `false`. The default value is `true`.                                 |

To validate access to the target URI, select **Validate**. After validation completes successfully, select **Apply** to update the configuration settings.

## Polyglot support

The Application Configuration Service for Tanzu works seamlessly with Spring Boot applications. The properties generated by the service are imported as external configurations by Spring Boot and injected into the beans. You don't need to write extra code. You can consume the values by using the `@Value` annotation, accessed through Spring's Environment abstraction, or you can bind them to structured objects by using the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation.

The Application Configuration Service also supports polyglot apps like dotNET, Go, Python, and so on. To access config files that you specify to load during polyglot app deployment in the apps, try to access a file path that you can retrieve through an environment variable with a name such as `AZURE_SPRING_APPS_CONFIG_FILE_PATH`. You can access all your intended config files under that path. To access the property values in the config files, use the existing read/write file libraries for your app.

## Refresh strategies

Use the following steps to refresh your Java Spring Boot application configuration after you update the configuration file in the Git repository.

1. Load the configuration to Application Configuration Service for Tanzu.

   The refresh frequency is managed by Azure Spring Apps and fixed to 60 seconds.

1. Load the configuration to your application.

A Spring application holds the properties as the beans of the Spring Application Context via the Environment interface. The following list shows several ways to load the new configurations:

- Restart the application. Restarting the application always loads the new configuration.

- Call the `/actuator/refresh` endpoint exposed on the config client via the Spring Actuator.

   To use this method, add the following dependency to your configuration client’s *pom.xml* file.

   ``` xml
   <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

   You can also enable the actuator endpoint by adding the following configurations:

   ```properties
   management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=refresh, bus-refresh, beans, env
   ```

   After you reload the property sources by calling the `/actuator/refresh` endpoint, the attributes bound with `@Value` in the beans having the annotation `@RefreshScope` are refreshed.

   ``` java
   @Service
   @Getter @Setter
   @RefreshScope
   public class MyService {
      @Value
      private Boolean activated;
   }
   ```

   Use curl with the application endpoint to refresh the new configuration.

   ``` bash
   curl -X POST http://{app-endpoint}/actuator/refresh
   ```
