# Configure an AKS cluster

As part of creating an AKS cluster, you may need to customize your cluster configuration to suit your needs. This article introduces a few options for customizing your AKS cluster.

## OS configuration

AKS supports Ubuntu 18.04 as the default node operating system (OS) in general availability (GA) for clusters.

## Container runtime configuration

A container runtime is software that executes containers and manages container images on a node. The runtime helps abstract away sys-calls or operating system (OS) specific functionality to run containers on Linux or Windows. Linux node pools use `containerd` for node pools using Kubernetes version 1.19 and greater. On Windows Server 2019 node pools, `containerd` is generally available and the only container runtime option on Kubernetes 1.21 and greater. Docker is no longer supported as of September 2022. For more information about this deprecation, see the [AKS release notes][aks-release-notes].

[`Containerd`](https://containerd.io/) is an [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) (Open Container Initiative) compliant core container runtime that provides the minimum set of required functionality to execute containers and manage images on a node. `Containerd` was [donated](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2017/03/29/containerd-joins-cloud-native-computing-foundation/) to the Cloud Native Compute Foundation (CNCF) in March of 2017. The current Moby (upstream Docker) version that AKS uses is built on top of `containerd`.

With a `containerd`-based node and node pools, instead of talking to the `dockershim`, the kubelet talks directly to `containerd` using the CRI (container runtime interface) plugin, removing extra hops in the data flow when compared to the Docker CRI implementation. As such, you see better pod startup latency and less resource (CPU and memory) usage.

By using `containerd` for AKS nodes, pod startup latency improves and node resource consumption by the container runtime decreases. These improvements through this new architecture enable kubelet communicating directly to `containerd` through the CRI plugin. While in a Moby/docker architecture, kubelet communicates to the `dockershim` and docker engine before reaching `containerd`, therefore having extra hops in the data flow.

![Docker CRI 2](media/cluster-configuration/containerd-cri.png)

`Containerd` works on every GA version of Kubernetes in AKS, and in every newer Kubernetes version above v1.19, and supports all Kubernetes and AKS features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clusters with Linux node pools created on Kubernetes v1.19 or greater default to `containerd` for its container runtime. Clusters with node pools on a earlier supported Kubernetes versions receive Docker for their container runtime. Linux node pools will be updated to `containerd` once the node pool Kubernetes version is updated to a version that supports `containerd`.
>
> `containerd` with Windows Server 2019 node pools is generally available, and is the only container runtime option in Kubernetes 1.21 and higher. You can continue using Docker node pools and clusters on versions earlier than 1.23, but Docker is no longer supported as of September 2022. For more information, see [Add a Windows Server node pool with `containerd`][aks-add-np-containerd].
>
> It is highly recommended you test your workloads on AKS node pools with `containerd` before using clusters with a Kubernetes version that supports `containerd` for your node pools.

### `Containerd` limitations/differences

* For `containerd`, we recommend using [`crictl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/crictl) as a replacement CLI instead of the Docker CLI for **troubleshooting** pods, containers, and container images on Kubernetes nodes (for example, `crictl ps`).

   * `Containerd` doesn't provide the complete functionality of the docker CLI. It's available for troubleshooting only.
   * `crictl` offers a more kubernetes-friendly view of containers, with concepts like pods, etc. being present.

* `Containerd` sets up logging using the standardized `cri` logging format (which is different from what you currently get from docker's json driver). Your logging solution needs to support the `cri` logging format (like [Azure Monitor for Containers](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-new-cluster.md))
* You can no longer access the docker engine, `/var/run/docker.sock`, or use Docker-in-Docker (DinD).

  * If you currently extract application logs or monitoring data from Docker engine, use [Container insights](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-new-cluster.md) instead. AKS doesn't support running any out of band commands on the agent nodes that could cause instability.
  * Building images and directly using the Docker engine using the methods mentioned earlier aren't recommended. Kubernetes isn't fully aware of those consumed resources, and those methods present numerous issues as described [here](https://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/) and [here](https://securityboulevard.com/2018/05/escaping-the-whale-things-you-probably-shouldnt-do-with-docker-part-1/).

* Building images - You can continue to use your current Docker build workflow as normal, unless you're building images inside your AKS cluster. In this case, consider switching to the recommended approach for building images using [ACR Tasks](../container-registry/container-registry-quickstart-task-cli.md), or a more secure in-cluster option like [Docker Buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx).

## Generation 2 virtual machines

Azure supports [Generation 2 (Gen2) virtual machines (VMs)](../virtual-machines/generation-2.md). Generation 2 VMs support key features not supported in generation 1 VMs (Gen1). These features include increased memory, Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX), and virtualized persistent memory (vPMEM).

Generation 2 VMs use the new UEFI-based boot architecture rather than the BIOS-based architecture used by generation 1 VMs.
Only specific SKUs and sizes support Gen2 VMs. Check the [list of supported sizes](../virtual-machines/generation-2.md#generation-2-vm-sizes), to see if your SKU supports or requires Gen2.

Additionally not all VM images support Gen2, on AKS Gen2 VMs use the new [AKS Ubuntu 18.04 image](#os-configuration). This image supports all Gen2 SKUs and sizes.

## Default OS disk sizing

When you create a new cluster or add a new node pool to an existing cluster, by default the OS disk size is determined by the number for vCPUs. The number of vCPUs is based on the VM SKU, and in the following table we list the default values:

|VM SKU Cores (vCPUs)| Default OS Disk Tier | Provisioned IOPS | Provisioned Throughput (Mbps) |
|--|--|--|--|
| 1 - 7 | P10/128G | 500 | 100 |
| 8 - 15 | P15/256G | 1100 | 125 |
| 16 - 63 | P20/512G | 2300 | 150 |
| 64+ | P30/1024G | 5000 | 200 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Default OS disk sizing is only used on new clusters or node pools when ephemeral OS disks are not supported and a default OS disk size isn't specified. The default OS disk size may impact the performance or cost of your cluster, and you cannot change the OS disk size after cluster or node pool creation. This default disk sizing affects clusters or node pools created on July 2022 or later.

## Ephemeral OS

By default, Azure automatically replicates the operating system disk for a virtual machine to Azure storage to avoid data loss when the VM is relocated to another host. However, since containers aren't designed to have local state persisted, this behavior offers limited value while providing some drawbacks. These drawbacks include, but aren't limited to, slower node provisioning and higher read/write latency.

By contrast, ephemeral OS disks are stored only on the host machine, just like a temporary disk. This configuration provides lower read/write latency, along with faster node scaling and cluster upgrades.

Like the temporary disk, included in the price of the VM is an ephemeral OS disk.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you don't explicitly request managed disks for the OS, AKS defaults to ephemeral OS if possible for a given node pool configuration.

If you chose to use an ephemeral OS, the OS disk must fit in the VM cache. Size requirements and recommendations for VM cache are available in the [Azure VM documentation](../virtual-machines/ephemeral-os-disks.md).

If you chose to use the AKS default VM size [Standard_DS2_v2](../virtual-machines/dv2-dsv2-series.md#dsv2-series) SKU with the default OS disk size of 100 GB. The default VM size supports ephemeral OS, but only has 86 GiB of cache size. This configuration would default to managed disks if you don't explicitly specify it. If you do request an ephemeral OS, you receive a validation error.

If you request the same [Standard_DS2_v2](../virtual-machines/dv2-dsv2-series.md#dsv2-series) SKU with a 60 GiB OS disk, this configuration would default to ephemeral OS. The requested size of 60 GiB is smaller than the maximum cache size of 86 GiB.

If you select the [Standard_D8s_v3](../virtual-machines/dv3-dsv3-series.md#dsv3-series) SKU with 100 GB OS disk, this VM size supports ephemeral OS and has 200 GiB of cache space. If you don't specify the OS disk type, the node pool would receive ephemeral OS by default.

The latest generation of VM series doesn't have a dedicated cache, but only temporary storage. Let's assume to use the [Standard_E2bds_v5](../virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series.md#ebdsv5-series) VM size with the default OS disk size of 100 GiB as an example. This VM size supports ephemeral OS disks, but only has 75 GB of temporary storage. This configuration would default to managed OS disks if you don't explicitly specify it. If you do request an ephemeral OS disk, you receive a validation error.

If you request the same [Standard_E2bds_v5](../virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series.md#ebdsv5-series) VM size with a 60 GiB OS disk, this configuration defaults to ephemeral OS disks. The requested size of 60 GiB is smaller than the maximum temporary storage of 75 GiB.

If you chose to use [Standard_E4bds_v5](../virtual-machines/ebdsv5-ebsv5-series.md#ebdsv5-series) SKU with 100 GiB OS disk, this VM size supports ephemeral OS
and has 150 GiB of temporary storage. If you don't specify the OS disk type, by default Azure provisions an ephemeral OS disk to the node pool.

Ephemeral OS requires at least version 2.15.0 of the Azure CLI.

### Use Ephemeral OS on new clusters

Configure the cluster to use ephemeral OS disks when the cluster is created. Use the `--node-osdisk-type` flag to set Ephemeral OS as the OS disk type for the new cluster.

```azurecli
az aks create --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup -s Standard_DS3_v2 --node-osdisk-type Ephemeral
```

If you want to create a regular cluster using network-attached OS disks, you can do so by specifying `--node-osdisk-type=Managed`. You can also choose to add other ephemeral OS node pools as described below.

### Use Ephemeral OS on existing clusters

Configure a new node pool to use Ephemeral OS disks. Use the `--node-osdisk-type` flag to set as the OS disk type as the OS disk type for that node pool.

```azurecli
az aks nodepool add --name ephemeral --cluster-name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup -s Standard_DS3_v2 --node-osdisk-type Ephemeral
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With ephemeral OS you can deploy VM and instance images up to the size of the VM cache. In the AKS case, the default node OS disk configuration uses 128 GB, which means that you need a VM size that has a cache larger than 128 GB. The default Standard_DS2_v2 has a cache size of 86 GB, which isn't large enough. The Standard_DS3_v2 has a cache size of 172 GB, which is large enough. You can also reduce the default size of the OS disk by using `--node-osdisk-size`. The minimum size for AKS images is 30 GB.

If you want to create node pools with network-attached OS disks, you can do so by specifying `--node-osdisk-type Managed`.

## Mariner OS

Mariner can be deployed on AKS through Azure CLI or ARM templates.

### Prerequisites

1. You need the Azure CLI version 2.44.1 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version currently installed. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].
1. If you don't already have kubectl installed, install it through Azure CLI using `az aks install-cli` or follow the [upstream instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).

### Deploy an AKS Mariner cluster with Azure CLI

Use the following example commands to create a Mariner cluster.

```azurecli
az group create --name MarinerTest --location eastus

az aks create --name testMarinerCluster --resource-group MarinerTest --os-sku mariner --generate-ssh-keys

az aks get-credentials --resource-group MarinerTest --name testMarinerCluster

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

### Deploy an AKS Mariner cluster with an ARM template

To add Mariner to an existing ARM template, you need to do the following:

- Add `"osSKU": "mariner"` and `"mode": "System"` to agentPoolProfiles property.
- Set the apiVersion to 2021-03-01 or newer: `"apiVersion": "2021-03-01"`

The following deployment uses the ARM template `marineraksarm.json`.

    "controlPlaneFQDN": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "[reference(parameters('clusterName')).fqdn]"
    }
  }
}
```

Create this file on your system and include the settings defined in the `marineraksarm.json` file.

```azurecli
az group create --name MarinerTest --location eastus

az deployment group create --resource-group MarinerTest --template-file marineraksarm.json --parameters linuxAdminUsername=azureuser sshRSAPublicKey=`<contents of your id_rsa.pub>`

az aks get-credentials --resource-group MarinerTest --name testMarinerCluster

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

### Deploy an AKS Mariner cluster with Terraform

To deploy a Mariner cluster with Terraform, you first need to set your `azurerm` provider to version 2.76 or higher.

```
required_providers {
  azurerm = {
    source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
    version = "~> 2.76"
  }
}
```

Once you've updated your `azurerm` provider, you can specify the Mariner `os_sku` in `default_node_pool`.

```
default_node_pool {
  name = "default"
  node_count = 2
  vm_size = "Standard_D2_v2"
  os_sku = "CBLMariner"
}
```

Similarly, you can specify the Mariner `os_sku` in [`azurerm_kubernetes_cluster_node_pool`][azurerm-mariner].

## Custom resource group name

When you deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster in Azure, it also creates a second resource group for the worker nodes. By default, AKS names the node resource group `MC_resourcegroupname_clustername_location`, but you can specify a custom name.

To specify a custom resource group name, install the `aks-preview` Azure CLI extension version 0.3.2 or later. When using the Azure CLI, include the `--node-resource-group` parameter with the `az aks create` command to specify a custom name for the resource group. To deploy an AKS cluster with an Azure Resource Manager template, you can define the resource group name by using the `nodeResourceGroup` property.

```azurecli
az aks create --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --node-resource-group myNodeResourceGroup
```

The secondary resource group is automatically created by the Azure resource provider in your own subscription. You can only specify the custom resource group name during cluster creation.

As you work with the node resource group, keep in mind that you can't:

- Specify an existing resource group for the node resource group.
- Specify a different subscription for the node resource group.
- Change the node resource group name after creating the cluster.
- Specify names for the managed resources within the node resource group.
- Modify or delete Azure-created tags of managed resources within the node resource group.

## Node Restriction (Preview)

The [Node Restriction](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction) admission controller limits the Node and Pod objects a kubelet can modify. Node Restriction is on by default in AKS 1.24+ clusters.  If you're using an older version, use the following commands to create a cluster with Node Restriction, or update an existing cluster to add Node Restriction.

[!INCLUDE [preview features callout](./includes/preview/preview-callout.md)]

### Before you begin

You must have the following resource installed:

* The Azure CLI
* The `aks-preview` extension version 0.5.95 or later

#### Install the aks-preview CLI extension

```azurecli-interactive
# Install the aks-preview extension
az extension add --name aks-preview

# Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed
az extension update --name aks-preview
```

### Create an AKS cluster with Node Restriction

To create a cluster using Node Restriction.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create -n aks -g myResourceGroup --enable-node-restriction
```

### Update an AKS cluster with Node Restriction
