# AKS-managed Azure Active Directory integration

AKS-managed Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) integration simplifies the Azure AD integration process. Previously, you were required to create a client and server app, and the Azure AD tenant had to grant Directory Read permissions. Now, the AKS resource provider manages the client and server apps for you.

## Azure AD authentication overview

Cluster administrators can configure Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC) based on a user's identity or directory group membership. Azure AD authentication is provided to AKS clusters with OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. For more information on OpenID Connect, see the [Open ID connect documentation][open-id-connect].

Learn more about the Azure AD integration flow in the [Azure AD documentation](concepts-identity.md#azure-ad-integration).

## Limitations

* AKS-managed Azure AD integration can't be disabled.
* Changing an AKS-managed Azure AD integrated cluster to legacy Azure AD is not supported.
* Clusters without Kubernetes RBAC enabled aren't supported with AKS-managed Azure AD integration.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* Azure CLI version 2.29.0 or later.
* `kubectl`, with a minimum version of [1.18.1](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.18.md#v1181) or [`kubelogin`](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin).
* If you're using [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), you need a minimum version of helm 3.3.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must use `kubectl` with a minimum version of 1.18.1 or `kubelogin`. The difference between the minor versions of Kubernetes and `kubectl` shouldn't be more than 1 version. You'll experience authentication issues if you don't use the correct version.

Use the following commands to install kubectl and kubelogin:

```azurecli-interactive
sudo az aks install-cli
kubectl version --client
kubelogin --version
```

Use [these instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) for other operating systems.

## Before you begin

You need an Azure AD group for your cluster. This group will be registered as an admin group on the cluster to grant cluster admin permissions. You can use an existing Azure AD group or create a new one. Make sure to record the object ID of your Azure AD group.

```azurecli-interactive
# List existing groups in the directory
az ad group list --filter "displayname eq '<group-name>'" -o table
```

Use the following command to create a new Azure AD group for your cluster administrators:

```azurecli-interactive
# Create an Azure AD group
az ad group create --display-name myAKSAdminGroup --mail-nickname myAKSAdminGroup
```

## Create an AKS cluster with Azure AD enabled

1. Create an Azure resource group.

```azurecli-interactive
# Create an Azure resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location centralus
```

1. Create an AKS cluster and enable administration access for your Azure AD group.

```azurecli-interactive
# Create an AKS-managed Azure AD cluster
az aks create -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster --enable-aad --aad-admin-group-object-ids <id> [--aad-tenant-id <id>]
```

A successful creation of an AKS-managed Azure AD cluster has the following section in the response body:

```output
"AADProfile": {
    "adminGroupObjectIds": [
      "5d24****-****-****-****-****afa27aed"
    ],
    "clientAppId": null,
    "managed": true,
    "serverAppId": null,
    "serverAppSecret": null,
    "tenantId": "72f9****-****-****-****-****d011db47"
  }
```

## Access an Azure AD enabled cluster

Before you access the cluster using an Azure AD defined group, you'll need the [Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster User](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-user-role) built-in role.

1. Get the user credentials to access the cluster.

```azurecli-interactive
 az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster
```

1. Follow the instructions to sign in.

1. Use the kubectl `get nodes` command to view nodes in the cluster.

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get nodes

NAME                       STATUS   ROLES   AGE    VERSION
aks-nodepool1-15306047-0   Ready    agent   102m   v1.15.10
aks-nodepool1-15306047-1   Ready    agent   102m   v1.15.10
aks-nodepool1-15306047-2   Ready    agent   102m   v1.15.10
```

1. Configure [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](./azure-ad-rbac.md) to configure other security groups for your clusters.

## Troubleshooting access issues with Azure AD

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The steps described in this section bypass the normal Azure AD group authentication. Use them only in an emergency.

If you're permanently blocked by not having access to a valid Azure AD group with access to your cluster, you can still obtain the admin credentials to access the cluster directly.

To do these steps, you need to have access to the [Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#azure-kubernetes-service-cluster-admin-role) built-in role.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster --admin
```

## Enable AKS-managed Azure AD integration on your existing cluster

You can enable AKS-managed Azure AD integration on your existing Kubernetes RBAC enabled cluster. Make sure to set your admin group to keep access on your cluster.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update -g MyResourceGroup -n MyManagedCluster --enable-aad --aad-admin-group-object-ids <id-1> [--aad-tenant-id <id>]
```

A successful activation of an AKS-managed Azure AD cluster has the following section in the response body:

```output
"AADProfile": {
    "adminGroupObjectIds": [
      "5d24****-****-****-****-****afa27aed"
    ],
    "clientAppId": null,
    "managed": true,
    "serverAppId": null,
    "serverAppSecret": null,
    "tenantId": "72f9****-****-****-****-****d011db47"
  }
```

Download user credentials again to access your cluster by following the steps [here][access-cluster].

## Upgrading to AKS-managed Azure AD integration

If your cluster uses legacy Azure AD integration, you can upgrade to AKS-managed Azure AD integration by running the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster --enable-aad --aad-admin-group-object-ids <id> [--aad-tenant-id <id>]
```

A successful migration of an AKS-managed Azure AD cluster has the following section in the response body:

```output
"AADProfile": {
    "adminGroupObjectIds": [
      "5d24****-****-****-****-****afa27aed"
    ],
    "clientAppId": null,
    "managed": true,
    "serverAppId": null,
    "serverAppSecret": null,
    "tenantId": "72f9****-****-****-****-****d011db47"
  }
```

In order to access the cluster, follow the steps [here][access-cluster] to update kubeconfig.

## Non-interactive sign in with kubelogin

There are some non-interactive scenarios, such as continuous integration pipelines, that aren't currently available with `kubectl`. You can use [`kubelogin`](https://github.com/Azure/kubelogin) to connect to the cluster with a non-interactive service principal credential.

## Disable local accounts

When you deploy an AKS cluster, local accounts are enabled by default. Even when enabling RBAC or Azure AD integration, `--admin` access still exists as a non-auditable backdoor option. You can disable local accounts using the parameter `disable-local-accounts`. The `properties.disableLocalAccounts` field has been added to the managed cluster API to indicate whether the feature is enabled or not on the cluster.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * On clusters with Azure AD integration enabled, users assigned to an Azure AD administrators group specified by `aad-admin-group-object-ids` can still gain access using non-administrator credentials. On clusters without Azure AD integration enabled and `properties.disableLocalAccounts` set to `true`, any attempt to authenticate with user or admin credentials will fail.
>
> * After disabling local user accounts on an existing AKS cluster where users might have authenticated with local accounts, the administrator must [rotate the cluster certificates](certificate-rotation.md) to revoke certificates they might have had access to. If this is a new cluster, no action is required.

### Create a new cluster without local accounts

To create a new AKS cluster without any local accounts, use the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command with the `disable-local-accounts` flag.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create -g <resource-group> -n <cluster-name> --enable-aad --aad-admin-group-object-ids <aad-group-id> --disable-local-accounts
```

In the output, confirm local accounts have been disabled by checking the field `properties.disableLocalAccounts` is set to `true`.

```output
"properties": {
    ...
    "disableLocalAccounts": true,
    ...
}
```

Attempting to get admin credentials will fail with an error message indicating the feature is preventing access:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --admin

Operation failed with status: 'Bad Request'. Details: Getting static credential isn't allowed because this cluster is set to disable local accounts.
```

### Disable local accounts on an existing cluster

To disable local accounts on an existing Azure AD integration enabled AKS cluster, use the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command with the `disable-local-accounts` parameter.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update -g <resource-group> -n <cluster-name> --disable-local-accounts
```

In the output, confirm local accounts have been disabled by checking the field `properties.disableLocalAccounts` is set to `true`.

```output
"properties": {
    ...
    "disableLocalAccounts": true,
    ...
}
```

Attempting to get admin credentials will fail with an error message indicating the feature is preventing access:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --admin

Operation failed with status: 'Bad Request'. Details: Getting static credential isn't allowed because this cluster is set to disable local accounts.
```

### Re-enable local accounts on an existing cluster

AKS supports enabling a disabled local account on an existing cluster with the `enable-local-accounts` parameter.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update -g <resource-group> -n <cluster-name> --enable-local-accounts
```

In the output, confirm local accounts have been re-enabled by checking the field `properties.disableLocalAccounts` is set to `false`.

```output
"properties": {
    ...
    "disableLocalAccounts": false,
    ...
}
```

Attempting to get admin credentials will succeed:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group> --name <cluster-name> --admin

Merged "<cluster-name>-admin" as current context in C:\Users\<username>\.kube\config
```

## Use Conditional Access with Azure AD and AKS

When integrating Azure AD with your AKS cluster, you can also use [Conditional Access][aad-conditional-access] to control access to your cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD Conditional Access is an Azure AD Premium capability.

Complete the following steps to create an example Conditional Access policy to use with AKS:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Azure Active Directory** page.
2. From the left-hand pane, select **Enterprise applications**.
3. On the **Enterprise applications** page, from the left-hand pane select **Conditional Access**.
4. On the **Conditional Access** page, from the left-hand pane select **Policies** and then select **New policy**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/conditional-access-new-policy.png" alt-text="Adding a Conditional Access policy":::
5. Enter a name for the policy, for example **aks-policy**.
6. Under **Assignments** select **Users and groups**. Choose your users and groups you want to apply the policy to. In this example, choose the same Azure AD group that has administrator access to your cluster.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/conditional-access-users-groups.png" alt-text="Selecting users or groups to apply the Conditional Access policy":::
7. Under **Cloud apps or actions > Include**, select **Select apps**. Search for **Azure Kubernetes Service** and then select **Azure Kubernetes Service AAD Server**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/conditional-access-apps.png" alt-text="Selecting Azure Kubernetes Service AD Server for applying the Conditional Access policy":::
8. Under **Access controls > Grant**, select **Grant access**, **Require device to be marked as compliant**, and select **Select**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/conditional-access-grant-compliant.png" alt-text="Selecting to only allow compliant devices for the Conditional Access policy":::
9. Confirm your settings and set **Enable policy** to **On**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/conditional-access-enable-policy.png" alt-text="Enabling the Conditional Access policy":::
10. Select **Create** to create and enable your policy.

After creating the Conditional Access policy, perform the following steps to verify it has been successfully listed.

11. To get the user credentials to access the cluster, run the following command:

    ```azurecli-interactive
     az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster
    ```

12. Follow the instructions to sign in.

13. View nodes in the cluster with the `kubectl get nodes` command:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

14. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Active Directory**. From the left-hand pane select **Enterprise applications**, and then under **Activity** select **Sign-ins**.

15. Notice in the top of the results an event with a status of **Failed**, and under the **Conditional Access** column, a status of **Success**. Select the event and then select **Conditional Access** tab. Notice your Conditional Access policy is listed.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/conditional-access-sign-in-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows failed sign-in entry due to Conditional Access policy.":::

## Configure just-in-time cluster access with Azure AD and AKS

Another option for cluster access control is to use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for just-in-time requests.

>[!NOTE]
> PIM is an Azure AD Premium capability requiring a Premium P2 SKU. For more on Azure AD SKUs, see the [pricing guide][aad-pricing].

To integrate just-in-time access requests with an AKS cluster using AKS-managed Azure AD integration, complete the following steps:

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to **Azure Active Directory**.
1. Select **Properties**. Scroll down to the **Tenant ID** field. Your tenant ID will be in the box. Note this value as it's referenced later in a step as `<tenant-id>`.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/jit-get-tenant-id.png" alt-text="In a web browser, the Azure portal screen for Azure Active Directory is shown with the tenant's ID highlighted.":::
2. From the left-hand pane, under **Manage**, select **Groups** and then select **New group**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/jit-create-new-group.png" alt-text="Shows the Azure portal Active Directory groups screen with the 'New Group' option highlighted.":::
3. Verify the group type **Security** is selected and specify a group name, such as **myJITGroup**. Under the option **Azure AD roles can be assigned to this group (Preview)**, select **Yes** and then select **Create**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/jit-new-group-created.png" alt-text="Shows the Azure portal's new group creation screen.":::
4. On the **Groups** page, select the group you just created and note the Object ID. This will be referenced in a later step as `<object-id>`.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/jit-get-object-id.png" alt-text="Shows the Azure portal screen for the just-created group, highlighting the Object Id":::
5. Create the AKS cluster with AKS-managed Azure AD integration using the `az aks create` command with the `--aad-admin-group-objects-ids` and `--aad-tenant-id parameters` and include the values noted in the steps earlier.
    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster --enable-aad --aad-admin-group-object-ids <object-id> --aad-tenant-id <tenant-id>
    ```
6. In the Azure portal, select **Activity** from the left-hand pane. Select **Privileged Access (Preview)** and then select **Enable Privileged Access**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/jit-enabling-priv-access.png" alt-text="The Azure portal's Privileged access (Preview) page is shown, with 'Enable privileged access' highlighted":::
7. To grant access, select **Add assignments**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/jit-add-active-assignment.png" alt-text="The Azure portal's Privileged access (Preview) screen after enabling is shown. The option to 'Add assignments' is highlighted.":::
8. From the **Select role** drop-down list, select the users and groups you want to grant cluster access. These assignments can be modified at any time by a group administrator. Then select **Next**.
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/jit-adding-assignment.png" alt-text="The Azure portal's Add assignments Membership screen is shown, with a sample user selected to be added as a member. The option 'Next' is highlighted.":::
9.  Under **Assignment type**, select **Active** and then specify the desired duration. Provide a justification and then select **Assign**. For more information about assignment types, see [Assign eligibility for a privileged access group (preview) in Privileged Identity Management][aad-assignments].
    :::image type="content" source="./media/managed-aad/jit-set-active-assignment-details.png" alt-text="The Azure portal's Add assignments Setting screen is shown. An assignment type of 'Active' is selected and a sample justification has been given. The option 'Assign' is highlighted.":::

Once the assignments have been made, verify just-in-time access is working by accessing the cluster. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
 az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster
```

Follow the steps to sign in.

Use the `kubectl get nodes` command to view nodes in the cluster:

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get nodes
```

Note the authentication requirement and follow the steps to authenticate. If successful, you should see an output similar to the following output:

```output
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code AAAAAAAAA to authenticate.
NAME                                STATUS   ROLES   AGE     VERSION
aks-nodepool1-61156405-vmss000000   Ready    agent   6m36s   v1.18.14
aks-nodepool1-61156405-vmss000001   Ready    agent   6m42s   v1.18.14
aks-nodepool1-61156405-vmss000002   Ready    agent   6m33s   v1.18.14
```

### Apply Just-in-Time access at the namespace level

1. Integrate your AKS cluster with [Azure RBAC](manage-azure-rbac.md).
2. Associate the group you want to integrate with Just-in-Time access with a namespace in the cluster through role assignment.

```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment create --role "Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Reader" --assignee <AAD-ENTITY-ID> --scope $AKS_ID/namespaces/<namespace-name>
```

1. Associate the group you configured at the namespace level with PIM to complete the configuration.

### Troubleshooting

If `kubectl get nodes` returns an error similar to the following error:

```output
Error from server (Forbidden): nodes is forbidden: User "aaaa11111-11aa-aa11-a1a1-111111aaaaa" cannot list resource "nodes" in API group "" at the cluster scope
```

Make sure the admin of the security group has given your account an *Active* assignment.
