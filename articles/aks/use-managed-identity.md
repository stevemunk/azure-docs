# Use a managed identity in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters require an identity to access Azure resources like load balancers and managed disks. This identity can be a *managed identity* or *service principal*. A system-assigned managed identity is automatically created when you create an AKS cluster. This identity is managed by the Azure platform and doesn't require you to provision or rotate any secrets. For more information about managed identities in Azure AD, see [Managed identities for Azure resources][managed-identity-resources-overview].

AKS doesn't automatically create a [service principal](kubernetes-service-principal.md), so you have to create one. Clusters that use a service principal eventually expire, and the service principal must be renewed to keep the cluster working. Managing service principals adds complexity, so it's easier to use managed identities instead. The same permission requirements apply for both service principals and managed identities. Managed identities use certificate-based authentication. Each managed identity's credentials have an expiration of *90 days* and are rolled after *45 days*. AKS uses both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity types, and these identities are immutable.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're considering implementing [Azure AD pod-managed identity][aad-pod-identity] on your AKS cluster, we recommend you first review the [Azure AD workload identity overview][workload-identity-overview]. This authentication method replaces Azure AD pod-managed identity (preview) and is the recommended method.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have Azure CLI version 2.23.0 or later installed. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

For [use a pre-created kubelet managed identity][use-a-pre-created-kubelet-managed-identity], you need Azure CLI version 2.26.0 or later installed.

For [update control plane identity on an existing cluster][update-control-plane-identity-on-an-existing-cluster], you need Azure CLI version 2.49.0 or later installed.

## Limitations

* Tenants moving or migrating a managed identity-enabled cluster isn't supported.
* If the cluster has Azure AD pod-managed identity (`aad-pod-identity`) enabled, Node-Managed Identity (NMI) pods modify the iptables of the nodes to intercept calls to the Azure Instance Metadata (IMDS) endpoint. This configuration means any request made to the Metadata endpoint is intercepted by NMI, even if the pod doesn't use `aad-pod-identity`. AzurePodIdentityException CRD can be configured to inform `aad-pod-identity` of any requests to the Metadata endpoint originating from a pod that matches labels defined in CRD should be proxied without any processing in NMI. The system pods with `kubernetes.azure.com/managedby: aks` label in *kube-system* namespace should be excluded in  `aad-pod-identity` by configuring the AzurePodIdentityException CRD.
  * For more information, see [Disable aad-pod-identity for a specific pod or application](./use-azure-ad-pod-identity.md#clean-up).
  * To configure an exception, install the [mic-exception YAML](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/blob/master/deploy/infra/mic-exception.yaml).
* AKS doesn't support the use of a system-assigned managed identity if using a custom private DNS zone.

## Summary of managed identities

AKS uses several managed identities for built-in services and add-ons.

| Identity                       | Name    | Use case | Default permissions | Bring your own identity
|----------------------------|-----------|----------|
| Control plane | AKS Cluster Name | Used by AKS control plane components to manage cluster resources including ingress load balancers and AKS-managed public IPs, Cluster Autoscaler, Azure Disk, File, Blob CSI drivers. | Contributor role for Node resource group | Supported
| Kubelet | AKS Cluster Name-agentpool | Authentication with Azure Container Registry (ACR). | N/A (for kubernetes v1.15+) | Supported
| Add-on | AzureNPM | No identity required. | N/A | No
| Add-on | AzureCNI network monitoring | No identity required. | N/A | No
| Add-on | azure-policy (gatekeeper) | No identity required. | N/A | No
| Add-on | azure-policy | No identity required. | N/A | No

## Enable managed identities on a new AKS cluster

> [!NOTE]
> AKS creates a user-assigned kubelet identity in the node resource group if you don't [specify your own kubelet managed identity][Use a pre-created kubelet managed identity].

1. Create an Azure resource group using the [`az group create`][az-group-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westus2
    ```

2. Create an AKS cluster using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster --enable-managed-identity
    ```

3. Get credentials to access the cluster using the [`az aks get-credentials`][az-aks-get-credentials] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster
    ```

## Enable managed identities on an existing AKS cluster

* Update an existing AKS cluster currently using a service principal to work with a system-assigned managed identity using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update -g myResourceGroup -n myManagedCluster --enable-managed-identity
    ```

After updating your cluster, the control plane and pods use the managed identity. kubelet continues using a service principal until you upgrade your agentpool. You can use the `az aks nodepool upgrade --resource-group myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster --name mynodepool --node-image-only` command on your nodes to update to a managed identity. A node pool upgrade causes downtime for your AKS cluster as the nodes in the node pools are cordoned/drained and reimaged.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Keep the following information in mind when updating your cluster:
>
> * An update only works if there's a VHD update to consume. If you're running the latest VHD, you need to wait until the next VHD is available in order to perform the update.
>
> * The Azure CLI ensures your addon's permission is correctly set after migrating. If you're not using the Azure CLI to perform the migrating operation, you need to handle the addon identity's permission by yourself. For an example using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template, see [Assign Azure roles using ARM templates](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-template.md).
>
> * If your cluster was using `--attach-acr` to pull from images from Azure Container Registry, you need to run the `az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --attach-acr <ACR resource ID>` command after updating your cluster to let the newly-created kubelet used for managed identity get the permission to pull from ACR. Otherwise, you won't be able to pull from ACR after the update.

## Add role assignment for control plane identity

When you create and use your own VNet, attached Azure disk, static IP address, route table, or user-assigned kubelet identity where the resources are outside of the worker node resource group, the Azure CLI adds the role assignment automatically. If you're using an ARM template or another method, you need to use the Principal ID of the cluster managed identity to perform a role assignment.

If you're not using the Azure CLI, but you're using your own VNet, attached Azure disk, static IP address, route table, or user-assigned kubelet identity that's outside of the worker node resource group, we recommend using [user-assigned control plane identity][bring-your-own-control-plane-managed-identity]. For system-assigned control plane identity, we can't get the identity ID before creating cluster, which delays the role assignment from taking effect.

### Get the principal ID of control plane identity

* Get the existing identity's principal ID using the [`az identity show`][az-identity-show] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az identity show --ids <identity-resource-id>
    ```

    Your output should resemble the following example output:

    ```output
    {
      "clientId": "<client-id>",
      "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myIdentity",
      "location": "eastus",
      "name": "myIdentity",
      "principalId": "<principal-id>",
      "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
      "tags": {},
      "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
      "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"
    }
    ```

### Add role assignment

For a VNet, attached Azure disk, static IP address, or route table outside the default worker node resource group, you need to assign the `Contributor` role on the custom resource group.

* Assign the `Contributor` role on the custom resource group using the [`az role assignment create`][az-role-assignment-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az role assignment create --assignee <control-plane-identity-principal-id> --role "Contributor" --scope "<custom-resource-group-resource-id>"
    ```

For a user-assigned kubelet identity outside the default worker node resource group, you need to assign the [Managed Identity Operator][managed-identity-operator] role on the kubelet identity for control plane identity.

* Assign the `Managed Identity Operator` role on the kubelet identity using the [`az role assignment create`][az-role-assignment-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az role assignment create --assignee  <control-plane-identity-principal-id> --role "Managed Identity Operator" --scope "<kubelet-identity-resource-id>"
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> It may take up to 60 minutes for the permissions granted to your cluster's managed identity to populate.

## Bring your own control plane managed identity

### Create a cluster using user-assigned control plane identity

A custom control plane managed identity enables access to the existing identity prior to cluster creation. This feature enables scenarios such as using a custom VNet or outboundType of UDR with a pre-created managed identity.

> [!NOTE]
>
> USDOD Central, USDOD East, and USGov Iowa regions in Azure US Government cloud aren't supported.
>
> AKS creates a user-assigned kubelet identity in the node resource group if you don't [specify your own kubelet managed identity][Use a pre-created kubelet managed identity].

* If you don't have a managed identity, create one using the [`az identity create`][az-identity-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az identity create --name myIdentity --resource-group myResourceGroup
    ```

    Your output should resemble the following example output:

    ```output
    {                                  
      "clientId": "<client-id>",
      "clientSecretUrl": "<clientSecretUrl>",
      "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myIdentity", 
      "location": "westus2",
      "name": "myIdentity",
      "principalId": "<principal-id>",
      "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",                       
      "tags": {},
      "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
      "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"
    }
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> It may take up to 60 minutes for the permissions granted to your cluster's managed identity to populate.

* Before creating the cluster, [add the role assignment for control plane identity][add-role-assignment-for-control-plane-identity] using the [`az role assignment create`][az-role-assignment-create] command.

* Create the cluster with user-assigned control plane identity.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --name myManagedCluster \
        --network-plugin azure \
        --vnet-subnet-id <subnet-id> \
        --docker-bridge-address 172.17.0.1/16 \
        --dns-service-ip 10.2.0.10 \
        --service-cidr 10.2.0.0/24 \
        --enable-managed-identity \
        --assign-identity <identity-resource-id>
    ```

### Update control plane identity on an existing cluster 

* If you don't have a managed identity, create one using the [`az identity create`][az-identity-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az identity create --name myIdentity --resource-group myResourceGroup
    ```

    Your output should resemble the following example output:

    ```output
    {                                  
      "clientId": "<client-id>",
      "clientSecretUrl": "<clientSecretUrl>",
      "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myIdentity", 
      "location": "westus2",
      "name": "myIdentity",
      "principalId": "<principal-id>",
      "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",                       
      "tags": {},
      "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
      "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"
    }
    ```
  
* After creating the identity, [add the role assignment for control plane identity][add-role-assignment-for-control-plane-identity] using the [`az role assignment create`][az-role-assignment-create] command.

* Update your cluster with your existing identities using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command. Make sure you provide the control plane identity resource ID for `assign-identity`.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --name myManagedCluster \
        --enable-managed-identity \
        --assign-identity <identity-resource-id> 
    ```

    Your output for a successful cluster update using your own kubelet managed identity should resemble the following example output:

    ```output
      "identity": {
        "principalId": null,
        "tenantId": null,
        "type": "UserAssigned",
        "userAssignedIdentities": {
          "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/resourcegroups/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myIdentity": {
            "clientId": "<client-id>",
            "principalId": "<principal-id>"
          }
        }
      },
    ```

## Use a pre-created kubelet managed identity

A kubelet identity enables access to the existing identity prior to cluster creation. This feature enables scenarios such as connection to ACR with a pre-created managed identity.

### Pre-created kubelet identity limitations

* Only works with a user-assigned managed cluster.
* The China East and China North regions in Azure China 21Vianet aren't supported.

### Create user-assigned managed identities

#### Control plane managed identity

* If you don't have a control plane managed identity, create one using the [`az identity create`][az-identity-create].

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az identity create --name myIdentity --resource-group myResourceGroup
    ```

    Your output should resemble the following example output:

    ```output
    {                                  
      "clientId": "<client-id>",
      "clientSecretUrl": "<clientSecretUrl>",
      "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myIdentity", 
      "location": "westus2",
      "name": "myIdentity",
      "principalId": "<principal-id>",
      "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",                       
      "tags": {},
      "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
      "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"
    }
    ```

#### kubelet managed identity

* If you don't have a kubelet managed identity, create one using the [`az identity create`][az-identity-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az identity create --name myKubeletIdentity --resource-group myResourceGroup
    ```

    Your output should resemble the following example output:

    ```output
    {
      "clientId": "<client-id>",
      "clientSecretUrl": "<clientSecretUrl>",
      "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myKubeletIdentity", 
      "location": "westus2",
      "name": "myKubeletIdentity",
      "principalId": "<principal-id>",
      "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",                       
      "tags": {},
      "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
      "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"
    }
    ```

### Create a cluster using user-assigned kubelet identity

Now you can create your AKS cluster with your existing identities. Make sure to provide the control plane identity resource ID via `assign-identity` and the kubelet managed identity via `assign-kubelet-identity`.

* Create an AKS cluster with your existing identities using the [`az aks create`][az-aks-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks create \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --name myManagedCluster \
        --network-plugin azure \
        --vnet-subnet-id <subnet-id> \
        --docker-bridge-address 172.17.0.1/16 \
        --dns-service-ip 10.2.0.10 \
        --service-cidr 10.2.0.0/24 \
        --enable-managed-identity \
        --assign-identity <identity-resource-id> \
        --assign-kubelet-identity <kubelet-identity-resource-id>
    ```

    A successful AKS cluster creation using your own kubelet managed identity should resemble the following example output:

    ```output
      "identity": {
        "principalId": null,
        "tenantId": null,
        "type": "UserAssigned",
        "userAssignedIdentities": {
          "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/resourcegroups/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myIdentity": {
            "clientId": "<client-id>",
            "principalId": "<principal-id>"
          }
        }
      },
      "identityProfile": {
        "kubeletidentity": {
          "clientId": "<client-id>",
          "objectId": "<object-id>",
          "resourceId": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/resourcegroups/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myKubeletIdentity"
        }
      },
    ```

### Update an existing cluster using kubelet identity

> [!WARNING]
> Updating kubelet managed identity upgrades node pools, which causes downtime for your AKS cluster as the nodes in the node pools will be cordoned/drained and reimaged.

> [!NOTE]
> If your cluster was using `--attach-acr` to pull from images from Azure Container Registry, you need to run the `az aks update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --attach-acr <ACR Resource ID>` command after updating your cluster to let the newly-created kubelet used for managed identity get the permission to pull from ACR. Otherwise, you won't be able to pull from ACR after the upgrade.

#### Make sure your CLI version is updated

1. Check your CLI version using the [`az version`][az-version] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az version
    ```

2. Upgrade your CLI version using the [`az upgrade`][az-upgrade] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az upgrade
    ```

#### Get the current control plane identity for your AKS cluster

1. Confirm your AKS cluster is using the user-assigned control plane identity using the [`az aks show`][az-aks-show] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks show -g <RGName> -n <ClusterName> --query "servicePrincipalProfile"
    ```

    If your cluster is using a managed identity, the output shows `clientId` with a value of **msi**. A cluster using a service principal shows an object ID. For example:

    ```output
    {
      "clientId": "msi"
    }
    ```

2. After confirming your cluster is using a managed identity, find the control plane identity's resource ID using the [`az aks show`][az-aks-show] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks show -g <RGName> -n <ClusterName> --query "identity"
    ```

    For a user-assigned control plane identity, your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    {
      "principalId": null,
      "tenantId": null,
      "type": "UserAssigned",
      "userAssignedIdentities": <identity-resource-id>
          "clientId": "<client-id>",
          "principalId": "<principal-id>"
    },
    ```

#### Update your cluster with kubelet identity

1. If you don't have a kubelet managed identity, create one using the [`az identity create`][az-identity-create] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az identity create --name myKubeletIdentity --resource-group myResourceGroup
    ```

    Your output should resemble the following example output:

    ```output
    {
      "clientId": "<client-id>",
      "clientSecretUrl": "<clientSecretUrl>",
      "id": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myKubeletIdentity",
      "location": "westus2",
      "name": "myKubeletIdentity",
      "principalId": "<principal-id>",
      "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",                       
      "tags": {},
      "tenantId": "<tenant-id>",
      "type": "Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities"
    }
    ```

2. Update your cluster with your existing identities using the [`az aks update`][az-aks-update] command. Make sure you provide the control plane identity resource ID for `assign-identity` and the kubelet managed identity for `assign-kubelet-identity`.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update \
        --resource-group myResourceGroup \
        --name myManagedCluster \
        --enable-managed-identity \
        --assign-identity <identity-resource-id> \
        --assign-kubelet-identity <kubelet-identity-resource-id>
    ```

    Your output for a successful cluster update using your own kubelet managed identity should resemble the following example output:

    ```output
      "identity": {
        "principalId": null,
        "tenantId": null,
        "type": "UserAssigned",
        "userAssignedIdentities": {
          "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/resourcegroups/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myIdentity": {
            "clientId": "<client-id>",
            "principalId": "<principal-id>"
          }
        }
      },
      "identityProfile": {
        "kubeletidentity": {
          "clientId": "<client-id>",
          "objectId": "<object-id>",
          "resourceId": "/subscriptions/<subscriptionid>/resourcegroups/resourcegroups/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myKubeletIdentity"
        }
      },
    ```
