# Supported Kubernetes versions in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

The Kubernetes community releases minor versions roughly every three months. Recently, the Kubernetes community has [increased the support window for each version from nine months to one year](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/31/kubernetes-1-19-feature-one-year-support/), starting with version 1.19.

Minor version releases include new features and improvements. Patch releases are more frequent (sometimes weekly) and are intended for critical bug fixes within a minor version. Patch releases include fixes for security vulnerabilities or major bugs.

## Kubernetes versions

Kubernetes uses the standard [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme for each version:

```
[major].[minor].[patch]

Examples:
  1.17.7
  1.17.8
```

Each number in the version indicates general compatibility with the previous version:

* **Major versions** change when incompatible API updates or backwards compatibility may be broken.
* **Minor versions** change when functionality updates are made that are backwards compatible to the other minor releases.
* **Patch versions** change when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made.

Aim to run the latest patch release of the minor version you're running. For example, if your production cluster is on **`1.17.7`**, **`1.17.8`** is the latest available patch version available for the *1.17* series. You should upgrade to **`1.17.8`** as soon as possible to ensure your cluster is fully patched and supported.

## AKS Kubernetes release calendar

View the upcoming version releases on the AKS Kubernetes release calendar. To see real-time updates of region release status and version release notes, visit the [AKS release status webpage][aks-release]. To learn more about the release status webpage, see [AKS release tracker][aks-tracker].

> [!NOTE]
> AKS follows 12 months of support for a generally available (GA) Kubernetes version. To read more about our support policy for Kubernetes versioning, please read our [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli#faq).

For the past release history, see [Kubernetes history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes#History).

|  K8s version | Upstream release  | AKS preview  | AKS GA  | End of life |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| 1.22  | Aug-04-21 | Sept 2021   | Dec 2021  | Dec 2022 |
| 1.23  | Dec 2021 | Jan 2022   | Apr 2022  | Apr 2023 |
| 1.24 | Apr-22-22 | May 2022 | Jul 2022 | Jul 2023
| 1.25 | Aug 2022 | Oct 2022 | Dec 2022 | Dec 2023

## Alias minor version

> [!NOTE]
> Alias minor version requires Azure CLI version 2.37 or above as well as API version 20220201 or above. Use `az upgrade` to install the latest version of the CLI.

With AKS, you can create a cluster without specifying the exact patch version. When you create a cluster without designating a patch, the cluster will run the minor version's latest GA patch. For example, if you create a cluster with **`1.21`**, your cluster will run **`1.21.7`**, which is the latest GA patch version of *1.21*.

When you upgrade by alias minor version, only a higher minor version is supported. For example, upgrading from `1.14.x` to `1.14` won't trigger an upgrade to the latest GA `1.14` patch, but upgrading to `1.15` will trigger an upgrade to the latest GA `1.15` patch.

To see what patch you're on, run the `az aks show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster` command. The `currentKubernetesVersion` property shows the whole Kubernetes version.

```
{
 "apiServerAccessProfile": null,
  "autoScalerProfile": null,
  "autoUpgradeProfile": null,
  "azurePortalFqdn": "myaksclust-myresourcegroup.portal.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io",
  "currentKubernetesVersion": "1.21.7",
}
```

## Kubernetes version support policy

AKS defines a GA version as a version enabled in all SLO or SLA measurements and available in all regions. AKS supports three GA minor versions of Kubernetes:

* The latest GA minor version released in AKS (which we'll refer to as N).
* Two previous minor versions.
  * Each supported minor version also supports a maximum of two (2) stable patches.

AKS may also support preview versions, which are explicitly labeled and subject to [preview terms and conditions][preview-terms].

> [!NOTE]
> AKS uses safe deployment practices which involve gradual region deployment. This means it may take up to 10 business days for a new release or a new version to be available in all regions.

The supported window of Kubernetes versions on AKS is known as "N-2": (N (Latest release) - 2 (minor versions)).

For example, if AKS introduces *1.17.a* today, support is provided for the following versions:

New minor version    |    Supported Version List
-----------------    |    ----------------------
1.17.a               |    1.17.a, 1.17.b, 1.16.c, 1.16.d, 1.15.e, 1.15.f

Where ".letter" is representative of patch versions.

When a new minor version is introduced, the oldest minor version and patch releases supported are deprecated and removed. For example, if the current supported version list is:

```
1.17.a
1.17.b
1.16.c
1.16.d
1.15.e
1.15.f
```

When AKS releases 1.18.\*, all the 1.15.\* versions go out of support 30 days later.

> [!NOTE]
> If customers are running an unsupported Kubernetes version, they'll be asked to upgrade when requesting support for the cluster. Clusters running unsupported Kubernetes releases aren't covered by the [AKS support policies](./support-policies.md).

In addition to the above, AKS supports a maximum of two **patch** releases of a given minor version. So given the following supported versions:

```
Current Supported Version List
------------------------------
1.17.8, 1.17.7, 1.16.10, 1.16.9
```

If AKS releases `1.17.9` and `1.16.11`, the oldest patch versions are deprecated and removed, and the supported version list becomes:

```
New Supported Version List
----------------------
1.17.*9*, 1.17.*8*, 1.16.*11*, 1.16.*10*
```

### Supported `kubectl` versions

You can use one minor version older or newer of `kubectl` relative to your *kube-apiserver* version, consistent with the [Kubernetes support policy for kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#kubectl).

For example, if your *kube-apiserver* is at *1.17*, then you can use versions *1.16* to *1.18* of `kubectl` with that *kube-apiserver*.

To install or update `kubectl` to the latest version, run:

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

```azurecli
az aks install-cli
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

```powershell
Install-AzAksKubectl -Version latest
```

---

## Release and deprecation process

You can reference upcoming version releases and deprecations on the [AKS Kubernetes release calendar](#aks-kubernetes-release-calendar).

For new **minor** versions of Kubernetes:

* AKS publishes a pre-announcement with the planned date of the new version release and respective old version deprecation. This announcement is published on the [AKS release notes](https://aka.ms/aks/releasenotes) at least 30 days before removal.
* AKS uses [Azure Advisor](../advisor/advisor-overview.md) to alert users if a new version will cause issues in their cluster because of deprecated APIs. Azure Advisor is also used to alert the user if they're currently out of support.
* AKS publishes a [service health notification](../service-health/service-health-overview.md) available to all users with AKS and portal access and sends an email to the subscription administrators with the planned version removal dates.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Visit [manage Azure subscriptions](../cost-management-billing/manage/add-change-subscription-administrator.md#assign-a-subscription-administrator) to determine who your subscription administrators are and make any necessary changes.

* Users have **30 days** from version removal to upgrade to a supported minor version release to continue receiving support.

For new **patch** versions of Kubernetes:

* Because of the urgent nature of patch versions, they can be introduced into the service as they become available. Once available, patches will have a two month minimum lifecycle.
* In general, AKS doesn't broadly communicate the release of new patch versions. However, AKS constantly monitors and validates available CVE patches to support them in AKS in a timely manner. If a critical patch is found or user action is required, AKS will notify users to upgrade to the newly available patch.
* Users have **30 days** from a patch release's removal from AKS to upgrade into a supported patch and continue receiving support. However, you'll **no longer be able to create clusters or node pools once the version is deprecated/removed.**

### Supported versions policy exceptions

AKS reserves the right to add or remove new/existing versions with one or more critical production-impacting bugs or security issues without advance notice.

Specific patch releases may be skipped or rollout accelerated, depending on the severity of the bug or security issue.

## Azure portal and CLI versions

When you deploy an AKS cluster with Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, the cluster defaults to the N-1 minor version and latest patch. For example, if AKS supports *1.17.a*, *1.17.b*, *1.16.c*, *1.16.d*, *1.15.e*, and *1.15.f*, the default version selected is *1.16.c*.

### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

To find out what versions are currently available for your subscription and region, use the
[az aks get-versions][az-aks-get-versions] command. The following example lists available Kubernetes versions for the *EastUS* region:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks get-versions --location eastus --output table
```

### [Azure PowerShell](#tab/azure-powershell)

To find out what versions are currently available for your subscription and region, use the
[Get-AzAksVersion][get-azaksversion] cmdlet. The following example lists available Kubernetes versions for the *EastUS* region:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzAksVersion -Location eastus
```

## FAQ

### How does Microsoft notify me of new Kubernetes versions?

The AKS team publishes pre-announcements with planned dates of the new Kubernetes versions in the AKS docs, our [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases), and emails to subscription administrators who own clusters that are going to fall out of support. AKS also uses [Azure Advisor](../advisor/advisor-overview.md) to alert customers in the Azure portal to notify users if they're out of support. It also alerts them of deprecated APIs that will affect their application or development processes.

### How often should I expect to upgrade Kubernetes versions to stay in support?

Starting with Kubernetes 1.19, the [open source community has expanded support to one year](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/31/kubernetes-1-19-feature-one-year-support/). AKS commits to enabling patches and support matching the upstream commitments. For AKS clusters on 1.19 and greater, you'll be able to upgrade at a minimum of once a year to stay on a supported version.

### What happens when a user upgrades a Kubernetes cluster with a minor version that isn't supported?

If you're on the *n-3* version or older, it means you're outside of support and will be asked to upgrade. When your upgrade from version n-3 to n-2 succeeds, you're back within our support policies. For example:

* If the oldest supported AKS version is *1.15.a* and you're on *1.14.b* or older, you're outside of support.
* When you successfully upgrade from *1.14.b* to *1.15.a* or higher, you're back within our support policies.

Downgrades aren't supported.

### What does 'Outside of Support' mean?

'Outside of Support' means that:

* The version you're running is outside of the supported versions list.
* You'll be asked to upgrade the cluster to a supported version when requesting support, unless you're within the 30-day grace period after version deprecation.

Additionally, AKS doesn't make any runtime or other guarantees for clusters outside of the supported versions list.

### What happens when a user scales a Kubernetes cluster with a minor version that isn't supported?

For minor versions not supported by AKS, scaling in or out should continue to work. Since there are no guarantees with quality of service, we recommend upgrading to bring your cluster back into support.

### Can a user stay on a Kubernetes version forever?

If a cluster has been out of support for more than three (3) minor versions and has been found to carry security risks, Azure proactively contacts you to upgrade your cluster. If you don't take further action, Azure reserves the right to automatically upgrade your cluster on your behalf.

### What version does the control plane support if the node pool isn't in one of the supported AKS versions?

The control plane must be within a window of versions from all node pools. For details on upgrading the control plane or node pools, visit documentation on [upgrading node pools](use-multiple-node-pools.md#upgrade-a-cluster-control-plane-with-multiple-node-pools).

### Can I skip multiple AKS versions during cluster upgrade?

When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, Kubernetes minor versions can't be skipped. Kubernetes control planes [version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/) doesn't support minor version skipping. For example, upgrades between:

* *1.12.x* -> *1.13.x*: allowed.
* *1.13.x* -> *1.14.x*: allowed.
* *1.12.x* -> *1.14.x*: not allowed.

To upgrade from *1.12.x* -> *1.14.x*:

1. Upgrade from *1.12.x* -> *1.13.x*.
2. Upgrade from *1.13.x* -> *1.14.x*.

Skipping multiple versions can only be done when upgrading from an unsupported version back into the minimum supported version. For example, you can upgrade from an unsupported *1.10.x* to a supported *1.15.x* if *1.15* is the minimum supported minor version.

When performing an upgrade from an _unsupported version_ that skips two or more minor versions, the upgrade is performed without any guarantee of functionality and is excluded from the service-level agreements and limited warranty. If your version is significantly out of date, it's recommended to re-create the cluster.

### Can I create a new 1.xx.x cluster during its 30 day support window?

No. Once a version is deprecated/removed, you can't create a cluster with that version. As the change rolls out, you'll start to see the old version removed from your version list. This process may take up to two weeks from announcement, progressively by region.

### I'm on a freshly deprecated version, can I still add new node pools? Or will I have to upgrade?

No. You won't be allowed to add node pools of the deprecated version to your cluster. You can add node pools of a new version, but this may require you to update the control plane first.

### How often do you update patches?

Patches have a two month minimum lifecycle. To keep up to date when new patches are released, follow the [AKS release notes](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases).
