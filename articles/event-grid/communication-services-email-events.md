# Azure Communication Services - Email events

This article provides the properties and schema for communication services telephony and SMS events.Â For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md).

## Events types

Azure Communication Services emits the following telephony and SMS event types:

| Event type                                                  | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft.Communication.EmailDeliveryReportReceived                         | Published when a delivery report is received for an Email sent by the Communication Service. |
| Microsoft.Communication.EmailEngagementTrackingReportReceived           |    Published when the Email sent is either opened or the link, if applicable is clicked.  |

## Event responses

When an event is triggered, the Event Grid service sends data about that event to subscribing endpoints.

This section contains an example of what that data would look like for each event.

### Microsoft.Communication.EmailDeliveryReportReceived event
