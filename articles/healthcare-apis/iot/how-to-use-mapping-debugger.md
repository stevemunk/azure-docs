# How to use the MedTech service Mapping debugger

> [!NOTE]
> [Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR&#174;)](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) is an open healthcare specification.

In this article, you'll learn how to use the MedTech service Mapping debugger. The Mapping debugger is a self-service tool that is used for creating, updating, and troubleshooting the MedTech service device and FHIR destination mappings. The Mapping debugger enables you to easily view and make inline adjustments in real-time, without ever having to leave the Azure portal. The Mapping debugger can also be used for uploading test device messages to see how they'll look after being processed into normalized messages and transformed into FHIR Observations.

> [!TIP]
> To learn about how the MedTech service transforms and persists device message data into the FHIR service see, [Understand the device message data transformation](understand-service.md).

## Overview of the Mapping debugger

1. To access the MedTech service's Mapping debugger, select **Mapping debugger** within your MedTech service on the Azure portal. For this article, we'll be using a MedTech service named **mt-azuredocsdemo**. You'll select your own MedTech service. From this screen, we can see the Mapping debugger is presenting the device and FHIR destination mappings associated with this MedTech service and has provided a **Validation** of those mappings.

2. The Mapping debugger provides convenient features to help make the management, editing, and troubleshooting of device and FHIR destination mappings easier.

   **Upload** - With this selection, you can upload:
    - **Device mapping**: Can be edited and saved (optional) to the MedTech service.
    - **FHIR destination mapping**: Can be edited and saved (optional) to the MedTech service.
    - **Test device message**: Used by the validation service to produce a sample normalized measurement and FHIR Observation based on the supplied mappings.

   **Download** - With this selection you can download copies of:
     - **Device mapping**: The device mapping currently used by your MedTech service.
     - **FHIR destination mapping**: The FHIR destination mapping currently used by your MedTech service.
     - **Mappings**: Both mappings currently used by your MedTech service

## How to troubleshoot the device and FHIR destination mappings using the Mapping debugger

1. If there are errors with the device or FHIR destination mappings, the Mapping debugger will display the issues. In this example, we can see that there are error *warnings* at **Line 12** in the **Device mapping** and at **Line 20** in the **FHIR destination mapping**.

2. If you place your mouse cursor over an error warning, the Mapping debugger will provide you with more error information.

3. Using the suggestions provided by the Mapping debugger, we've now fixed the error warnings and are ready to select **Save** to commit our updated device and FHIR destination mappings to the MedTech service.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The MedTech service only saves the mappings that have been changed/updated. For example: If you only made a change to the **device mapping**, only those changes are saved to your MedTech service and no changes would be saved to the FHIR destination mapping. This is by design and to help with performance of the MedTech service.

4. Once the device and FHIR destination mappings are successfully saved, you'll receive confirmation from **Notifications** within the Azure portal.

## View a normalized message and FHIR Observation

1. The Mapping debugger gives you the ability to view sample outputs of the normalization and FHIR transformation processes by supplying a test device message. Select **Upload** and **Test device message**.

   :::image type="content" source="media\how-to-use-mapping-debugger\mapping-debugger-select-upload-and-test-device-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Mapping debugger and test device message box." lightbox="media\how-to-use-mapping-debugger\mapping-debugger-select-upload-and-test-device-message.png":::

2. The **Select a file** box will open. For this example, we'll select **Enter manually**.

   :::image type="content" source="media\how-to-use-mapping-debugger\mapping-debugger-select-test-device-message-manual.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Mapping debugger and Select a file box." lightbox="media\how-to-use-mapping-debugger\mapping-debugger-select-test-device-message-manual.png":::

3. Copy/paste or type the test device message into the **Upload test device message** box. The **Validation** box may still be *red* if the either of the mappings has an error/warning. As long as **No errors** is green, the test device message is valid. Select the **X** in the right corner to close the **Upload test device message** box.  

   :::image type="content" source="media\how-to-use-mapping-debugger\mapping-debugger-input-test-device-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Enter manually box with a validated test device message in the box." lightbox="media\how-to-use-mapping-debugger\mapping-debugger-input-test-device-message.png":::

4. Once a conforming test device message is uploaded, the **View normalized message** and **View FHIR observation** buttons will become available so that you may view the sample outputs of the normalization and FHIR transformation processes. These sample outputs can be used to validate your device and FHIR destination mappings are properly configured for processing events according to your requirement.

5. Use the **X** in the corner to close the **Normalized message** and **FHIR observation** boxes.
