# Manage NAT gateway

Learn how to create and remove a NAT gateway resource from a virtual network subnet. A NAT gateway enables outbound connectivity for resources in an Azure Virtual Network. You may wish to change the IP address or prefix your resources use for outbound connectivity to the internet. The public IP address and public IP address prefixes associated with the NAT gateway can be changed after deployment.

This article explains how to manage the following aspects of NAT gateway:

- Create a NAT gateway and associate it with an existing subnet.

- Remove a NAT gateway from an existing subnet and delete the resource.

- Add or remove a public IP address or public IP prefix.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- An existing Azure Virtual Network. For information about creating an Azure Virtual Network, see [Quickstart: Create a virtual network using the Azure portal](../quick-create-portal.md).
    
    - The example virtual network used in this article is named **myVNet**. Replace the example value with the name of your virtual network. 
    
    - The example subnet used in this article is named **mySubnet**. Replace the example value with the name of your subnet.
    
    - The example nat gateway used in this article is named **myNATgateway**.
    
[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment-no-header.md)]

- This how-to article requires version 2.31.0 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

- Azure PowerShell installed locally or Azure Cloud Shell.

- Sign in to Azure PowerShell and ensure you've selected the subscription with which you want to use this feature.  For more information, see [Sign in with Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/authenticate-azureps).

- Ensure your `Az.Network` module is 4.3.0 or later. To verify the installed module, use the command `Get-InstalledModule -Name "Az.Network"`. If the module requires an update, use the command `Update-Module -Name Az.Network` if necessary.

If you choose to install and use PowerShell locally, this article requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.4.1 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az` to find the installed version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-Az-ps). If you're running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/manage-nat-powershell)

### Public IP address

To create a NAT gateway with a public IP address, continue with the following steps.

Use [New-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress) to create a public IP address for the NAT gateway.

```azurepowershell
## Create public IP address for NAT gateway ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-NAT'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    Sku = 'Standard'
    AllocationMethod = 'Static'
}
New-AzPublicIpAddress @ip
```

Use [New-AzNatGateway](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznatgateway) to create a NAT gateway resource and associate the public IP you created previously. You'll use [Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/set-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig) to configure the NAT gateway for your virtual network subnet.

```azurepowershell
## Place the virtual network into a variable. ##
$net = @{
    Name = 'myVNet'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @net

## Place the public IP address you created previously into a variable. ##
$pip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-NAT'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$publicIP = Get-AzPublicIPAddress @pip

## Create NAT gateway resource ##
$nat = @{
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroupNAT'
    Name = 'myNATgateway'
    IdleTimeoutInMinutes = '10'
    Sku = 'Standard'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    PublicIpAddress = $publicIP
}
$natGateway = New-AzNatGateway @nat

## Create the subnet configuration. ##
$sub = @{
    Name = 'mySubnet'
    VirtualNetwork = $vnet
    NatGateway = $natGateway
}
Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @sub

## Save the configuration to the virtual network. ##
$vnet | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
```

### Public IP prefix

To create a NAT gateway with a public IP prefix, continue with the following steps.

Use [New-AzPublicIpPrefix](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipprefix) to create a public IP prefix for the NAT gateway.

```azurepowershell
## Create public IP prefix for NAT gateway ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIPPrefix-NAT'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    Sku = 'Standard'
    PrefixLength ='29'
}
New-AzPublicIpPrefix @ip
```

Use [New-AzNatGateway](/powershell/module/az.network/new-aznatgateway) to create a NAT gateway resource and associate the public IP prefix you created previously. You'll use [Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig](/powershell/module/az.network/set-azvirtualnetworksubnetconfig) to configure the NAT gateway for your virtual network subnet.

```azurepowershell
## Place the virtual network into a variable. ##
$net = @{
    Name = 'myVNet'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$vnet = Get-AzVirtualNetwork @net

## Place the public IP prefix you created previously into a variable. ##
$pip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIPPrefix-NAT'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$publicIPprefix = Get-AzPublicIPPrefix @pip

## Create NAT gateway resource ##
$nat = @{
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroupNAT'
    Name = 'myNATgateway'
    IdleTimeoutInMinutes = '10'
    Sku = 'Standard'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    PublicIpPrefix = $publicIPprefix
}
$natGateway = New-AzNatGateway @nat

## Create the subnet configuration. ##
$sub = @{
    Name = 'mySubnet'
    VirtualNetwork = $vnet
    NatGateway = $natGateway
}
Set-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig @sub

## Save the configuration to the virtual network. ##
$vnet | Set-AzVirtualNetwork
```

# [**Azure CLI**](#tab/manage-nat-cli)

### Public IP address

To create a NAT gateway with a public IP address, continue with the following steps.

Use [az network public-ip create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-create) to create a public IP address for the NAT gateway.

```azurecli
az network public-ip create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --location eastus2 \
    --name myPublicIP-NAT \
    --sku standard
```

Use [az network nat gateway create](/cli/azure/network/nat/gateway#az-network-nat-gateway-create) to create a NAT gateway resource and associate the public IP you created previously.

```azurecli
az network nat gateway create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myNATgateway \
    --public-ip-addresses myPublicIP-NAT \
    --idle-timeout 10

```

Use [az network vnet subnet update](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#az-network-vnet-subnet-update) to associate the NAT gateway with your virtual network subnet.

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet update \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --vnet-name myVNet \
    --name mySubnet \
    --nat-gateway myNATgateway
```

### Public IP prefix

To create a NAT gateway with a public IP prefix, continue with the following steps.

Use [az network public-ip prefix create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip/prefix#az-network-public-ip-prefix-create) to create a public IP prefix for the NAT gateway.

```azurecli
az network public-ip prefix create \
    --length 29 \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --location eastus2 \
    --name myPublicIPprefix-NAT
```

Use [az network nat gateway create](/cli/azure/network/nat/gateway#az-network-nat-gateway-create) to create a NAT gateway resource and associate the public IP prefix you created previously.

```azurecli
az network nat gateway create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \

7. Select **OK**.

8. Select **Save**.

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/manage-nat-powershell)

### Add public IP address

The public IP that you want to add to the NAT gateway must be added to an array object along with the current IP addresses. The PowerShell cmdlets do a full replace and not add when they're executed. 

For the purposes of this example, the existing IP address associated with the NAT gateway is named **myPublicIP-NAT**. Replace this value with the existing IP associated with your NAT gateway. If you have multiple IPs already configured, they must also be added to the array.

Use [New-AzPublicIpAddress](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipaddress) to create a new IP address for the NAT gateway.

```azurepowershell
## Create public IP address for NAT gateway ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-NAT2'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    Sku = 'Standard'
    AllocationMethod = 'Static'
}
New-AzPublicIpAddress @ip
```

Use [Set-AzNatGateway](/powershell/module/az.network/set-aznatgateway) to add the public IP address to the NAT gateway.

```azurepowershell
## Place NAT gateway into a variable. ##
$ng = @{
    Name = 'myNATgateway'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$nat = Get-AzNatGateway @ng

## Place the existing public IP address associated with the NAT gateway into a variable. ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-NAT'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$publicIP1 = Get-AzPublicIPaddress @ip

## Place the public IP address you created previously into a variable. ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-NAT2'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$publicIP2 = Get-AzPublicIPaddress @ip

## Place the public IP address variables into an array. ##
$pipArray = $publicIP1,$publicIP2

## Add the IP address to the NAT gateway. ##
$nt = @{
    NatGateway = $nat
    PublicIpAddress = $pipArray
}
Set-AzNatGateway @nt
```

### Remove public IP address

To remove a public IP from a NAT gateway, you must create an array object that **doesn't** contain the IP address you wish to remove. For example, you have a NAT gateway configured with two public IP addresses. You wish to remove one of the IP addresses. The IP addresses associated with the NAT gateway are named **myPublicIP-NAT** and **myPublicIP-NAT2**. To remove **myPublicIP-NAT2**, you create an array object for the PowerShell command that **only** contains **myPublicIP-NAT**. When you apply the command, the array is reapplied to the NAT gateway, and **myPublicIP-NAT** is the only public IP associated.

Use [Set-AzNatGateway](/powershell/module/az.network/set-aznatgateway) to remove a public IP address from the NAT gateway.

```azurepowershell
## Place NAT gateway into a variable. ##
$ng = @{
    Name = 'myNATgateway'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$nat = Get-AzNatGateway @ng

## Place the existing public IP prefix associated with the NAT gateway into a variable. ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-NAT'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$prefixIP1 = Get-AzPublicIPAddress @ip

## Place the secondary public IP address into a variable. ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIP-NAT2'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$publicIP2 = Get-AzPublicIPAddress @ip

## Place ONLY the public IP you wish to keep in the array. ##
$pipArray = $publicIP1

## Add the IP address prefix to the NAT gateway. ##
$nt = @{
    NatGateway = $nat
    PublicIpAddress = $pipArray
}
Set-AzNatGateway @nt
```

# [**Azure CLI**](#tab/manage-nat-cli)

### Add public IP address

For the purposes of this example, the existing public IP address associated with the NAT gateway is named **myPublicIP-NAT**.

Use [az network public-ip create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip#az-network-public-ip-create) to create a new IP address for the NAT gateway.

```azurecli
az network public-ip create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --location eastus2 \
    --name myPublicIP-NAT2 \
    --sku standard
```

Use [az network nat gateway update](/cli/azure/network/nat/gateway#az-network-nat-gateway-update) to add the public IP address you created previously to the NAT gateway. The Azure CLI command performs a replacement of the values, not an addition. To add the new IP address to the NAT gateway, you must also include any other IP addresses associated to the NAT gateway, or they'll be removed.

```azurecli
az network nat gateway update \
    --name myNATgateway \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --public-ip-addresses myPublicIP-NAT myPublicIP-NAT2
```

### Remove public IP address

Use [az network nat gateway update](/cli/azure/network/nat/gateway#az-network-nat-gateway-update) to remove a public IP address from the NAT gateway. The Azure CLI command performs a replacement of the values, not a subtraction. To remove a public IP address, you must include any IP address in the command that you wish to keep, and omit the one you wish to remove. For example, you have a NAT gateway configured with two public IP addresses. You wish to remove one of the IP addresses. The IP addresses associated with the NAT gateway are named **myPublicIP-NAT** and **myPublicIP-NAT2**. To remove **myPublicIP-NAT2**, you must omit the name of the IP from the command. The command will reapply the IPs listed in the command to the NAT gateway. Any IP not listed will be removed.

```azurecli
az network nat gateway update \
    --name myNATgateway \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --public-ip-addresses myPublicIP-NAT
```

# [**PowerShell**](#tab/manage-nat-powershell)

### Add public IP prefix

The public IP prefix that you want to add to the NAT gateway must be added to an array object along with the current IP prefixes. The PowerShell cmdlets do a full replace and not add when they're executed. 

For the purposes of this example, the existing public IP prefix associated with the NAT gateway is named **myPublicIPprefix-NAT**. Replace this value with the existing IP prefix associated with your NAT gateway. If you have multiple prefixes already configured, they must also be added to the array.

Use [New-AzPublicIpPrefix](/powershell/module/az.network/new-azpublicipprefix) to create a new public IP prefix for the NAT gateway.

```azurepowershell
## Create public IP prefix for NAT gateway ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIPPrefix-NAT2'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Location = 'eastus2'
    Sku = 'Standard'
    PrefixLength = '29'
}
New-AzPublicIpPrefix @ip
```

Use [Set-AzNatGateway](/powershell/module/az.network/set-aznatgateway) to add the public IP prefix to the NAT gateway.

```azurepowershell
## Place NAT gateway into a variable. ##
$ng = @{
    Name = 'myNATgateway'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$nat = Get-AzNatGateway @ng

## Place the existing public IP prefix associated with the NAT gateway into a variable. ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIPprefix-NAT'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$prefixIP1 = Get-AzPublicIPPrefix @ip

## Place the public IP prefix you created previously into a variable. ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIPprefix-NAT2'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$prefixIP2 = Get-AzPublicIPprefix @ip

## Place the public IP address variables into an array. ##
$preArray = $prefixIP1,$prefixIP2

## Add the IP address prefix to the NAT gateway. ##
$nt = @{
    NatGateway = $nat
    PublicIpPrefix = $preArray
}
Set-AzNatGateway @nt
```

### Remove public IP prefix

To remove a public IP prefix from a NAT gateway, you must create an array object that **doesn't** contain the IP address prefix you wish to remove. For example, you have a NAT gateway configured with two public IP prefixes. You wish to remove one of the IP prefixes. The IP prefixes associated with the NAT gateway are named **myPublicIPprefix-NAT** and **myPublicIPprefix-NAT2**. To remove **myPublicIPprefix-NAT2**, you create an array object for the PowerShell command that **only** contains **myPublicIPprefix-NAT**. When you apply the command, the array is reapplied to the NAT gateway, and **myPublicIPprefix-NAT** is the only prefix associated.

Use [Set-AzNatGateway](/powershell/module/az.network/set-aznatgateway) to remove a public IP prefix from the NAT gateway.

```azurepowershell
## Place NAT gateway into a variable. ##
$ng = @{
    Name = 'myNATgateway'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$nat = Get-AzNatGateway @ng

## Place the existing public IP prefix associated with the NAT gateway into a variable. ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIPprefix-NAT'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$prefixIP1 = Get-AzPublicIPPrefix @ip

## Place the secondary public IP prefix into a variable. ##
$ip = @{
    Name = 'myPublicIPprefix-NAT2'
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
}
$prefixIP2 = Get-AzPublicIPprefix @ip

## Place ONLY the prefix you wish to keep in the array. DO NOT ADD THE SECONDARY VARIABLE ##
$preArray = $prefixIP1

## Add the IP address prefix to the NAT gateway. ##
$nt = @{
    NatGateway = $nat
    PublicIpPrefix = $preArray
}
Set-AzNatGateway @nt
```

# [**Azure CLI**](#tab/manage-nat-cli)

### Add public IP prefix

For the purposes of this example, the existing public IP prefix associated with the NAT gateway is named **myPublicIPprefix-NAT**.

Use [az network public-ip prefix create](/cli/azure/network/public-ip/prefix#az-network-public-ip-prefix-create) to create a public IP prefix for the NAT gateway.

```azurecli
az network public-ip prefix create \
    --length 29 \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --location eastus2 \
    --name myPublicIPprefix-NAT2
```

Use [az network nat gateway update](/cli/azure/network/nat/gateway#az-network-nat-gateway-update) to add the public IP prefix you created previously to the NAT gateway. The Azure CLI command is a replacement of the values, not an addition. To add the new IP address prefix to the NAT gateway, you must also include any other IP prefixes associated to the NAT gateway, or they'll be removed.

```azurecli
az network nat gateway update \
    --name myNATgateway \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --public-ip-prefixes myPublicIPprefix-NAT myPublicIPprefix-NAT2
```

### Remove public IP prefix

Use [az network nat gateway update](/cli/azure/network/nat/gateway#az-network-nat-gateway-update) to remove a public IP prefix from the NAT gateway. The Azure CLI command is a replacement of the values and not subtraction. To remove a public IP prefix, you must include any prefix in the command that you wish to keep, and omit the one you wish to remove. For example, you have a NAT gateway configured with two public IP prefixes. You wish to remove one of the prefixes. The IP prefixes associated with the NAT gateway are named **myPublicIPprefix-NAT** and **myPublicIPprefix-NAT2**. To remove **myPublicIPprefix-NAT2**, you must omit the name of the IP prefix from the command. The command will reapply the IPs listed in the command to the NAT gateway. Any IP not listed will be removed.

```azurecli
az network nat gateway update \
