# Azure network round-trip latency statistics

Azure continuously monitors the latency (speed) of core areas of its network using internal monitoring tools and measurements.

## How are the measurements collected?

The latency measurements are collected from ThousandEyes agents, hosted in Azure cloud regions worldwide, that continuously sends network probes between themselves in 1-minute intervals. The monthly latency statistics are derived from averaging the collected samples for the month.

## Round-trip latency figures

The monthly Percentile P50 round trip times between Azure regions for a 30-day window are shown as follows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Monthly latency numbers across Azure regions do not change regulary. Given this, you can expect an update of this table every 6 to 9 months outside of the addition of new regions. When new regions come online, we will update this document as soon as data is available.
