# Connect to and manage Looker in Microsoft Purview (Preview)

This article outlines how to register Looker, and how to authenticate and interact with Looker in Microsoft Purview. For more information about Microsoft Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Labeling**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|**Data Sharing**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register)| [Yes](#scan)| No | [Yes](#scan) | No | No|  No| [Yes](#lineage)| No |

The supported Looker server version is 7.2.

When scanning Looker source, Microsoft Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Server
    - Folders
    - Projects
    - Models
    - Dashboards
    - Looks
    - Explore diagrams including the joins
    - Views including the dimensions, measures, parameters, and filters
    - Layouts including the chart layouts, table layouts, text, and fields

- Fetching static lineage on assets relationships among views and layouts.

When setting up scan, you can choose to scan an entire Looker server, or scope the scan to a subset of Looker projects matching the given name(s).

### Known limitations

When object is deleted from the data source, currently the subsequent scan won't automatically remove the corresponding asset in Microsoft Purview.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active [Microsoft Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).
- You need Data Source Administrator and Data Reader permissions to register a source and manage it in the Microsoft Purview governance portal. For more information about permissions, see [Access control in Microsoft Purview](catalog-permissions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **If your data store is not publicly accessible** (if your data store limits access from on-premises network, private network or specific IPs, etc.), **you will need to configure a self hosted integration runtime to connect to it**.

- If your data store isn't publicly accessible, set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, seeÂ [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md).
    - Ensure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) is installed on the machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed. Restart the machine after you newly install the JDK for it to take effect.
    - Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable (version Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 or newer) is installed on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don't have this update installed, [you can download it here](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

## Register

This section describes how to register Looker in Microsoft Purview using the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Authentication for registration

An API3 key is required to connect to the Looker server. The API3 key consists in a public client_id and a private client_secret and follows an OAuth2 authentication pattern.

### Steps to register

To register a new Looker server in your data catalog, follow these steps:

1. Open the Microsoft Purview governance portal by:

    - Browsing directly to [https://web.purview.azure.com](https://web.purview.azure.com) and selecting your Microsoft Purview account.
    - Opening the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), searching for and selecting the Microsoft Purview account. Selecting the [**the Microsoft Purview governance portal**](https://web.purview.azure.com/) button.
1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.
1. Select **Register.**

On the Register sources (Looker) screen, follow these steps:

1. Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the Catalog.

1. Enter the Looker API URL in the **Server API URL** field. The default port for API requests is port 19999. Also, all Looker API endpoints require an HTTPS connection. For example: 'https://azurepurview.cloud.looker.com'

## Scan

Follow the steps below to scan Looker to automatically identify assets. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md)

### Create and run scan

To create and run a new scan, follow these steps:

1. If your server is publicly accessible, skip to step two. Otherwise, you'll need to make sure your self-hosted integration runtime is configured:
    1. In the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/), got to the Management Center, and select **Integration runtimes**.
    1. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is available. If one isn't set up, use the steps mentioned [here](./manage-integration-runtimes.md) to set up a self-hosted integration runtime.

1. In the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/), navigate to **Sources**.

1. Select the registered **Looker** server.

1. Select **+ New scan**.

1. Provide the below details:

    1. **Name**: The name of the scan

    1. **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the Azure auto-resolved integration runtime if your server is publicly accessible, or your configured self-hosted integration runtime if it isn't publicly available.

    1. **Server API URL** is auto populated based on the value entered during registration.

    1. **Credential:** While configuring Looker credential, make sure to:

        * Select **Basic Authentication** as the Authentication method
        * Provide your Looker API3 key's client ID in the User name field
        * Save your Looker API3 key's client secret in the key vault's secret.

        To access client ID and client secret, navigate to Looker -\>Admin -\> Users -\> Select **Edit** on a user -\> Select **EditKeys** -\> Use the Client ID and Client Secret or create a new one.

        :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-looker-source/looker-details.png" alt-text="get looker details" border="true":::

        To understand more on credentials, refer to the link [here](manage-credentials.md)

    1. **Project filter** - Scope your scan by providing a semicolon separated list of Looker projects. This option is used to select looks and dashboards by their parent project.

    1. **Maximum memory available** (applicable when using self-hosted integration runtime): Maximum memory (in GB) available on customer's VM to be used by scanning processes. This is dependent on the size of erwin Mart to be scanned.

        :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-looker-source/setup-scan.png" alt-text="trigger scan" border="true":::

1. Select **Test connection** (available when using self-hosted integration runtime).

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Choose your **scan trigger**. You can set up a schedule or ran the scan once.

1. Review your scan and select on **Save and Run**.

## Lineage

After scanning your Looker source, you can [browse data catalog](how-to-browse-catalog.md) or [search data catalog](how-to-search-catalog.md) to view the asset details. 

Go to the asset -> lineage tab, you can see the asset relationship when applicable. Refer to the [supported capabilities](#supported-capabilities) section on the supported Looker lineage scenarios. For more information about lineage in general, see [data lineage](concept-data-lineage.md) and [lineage user guide](catalog-lineage-user-guide.md).
