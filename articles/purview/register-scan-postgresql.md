# Connect to and manage PostgreSQL in Microsoft Purview

This article outlines how to register PostgreSQL, and how to authenticate and interact with PostgreSQL in Microsoft Purview. For more information about Microsoft Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Labeling**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|**Data Sharing**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register)| [Yes](#scan)| No | [Yes](#scan) | No |No| No| [Yes](#lineage) | No |


The supported PostgreSQL server versions are 8.4 to 12.x.

When scanning PostgreSQL source, Microsoft Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Server
    - Databases
    - Schemas
    - Tables including the columns
    - Views including the columns
    
- Fetching static lineage on assets relationships among tables and views.

When setting up scan, you can choose to scan an entire PostgreSQL database, or scope the scan to a subset of schemas matching the given name(s) or name pattern(s).

### Known limitations

When object is deleted from the data source, currently the subsequent scan won't automatically remove the corresponding asset in Microsoft Purview.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An active [Microsoft Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).
- You need Data Source Administrator and Data Reader permissions to register a source and manage it in the Microsoft Purview governance portal. For more information about permissions, see [Access control in Microsoft Purview](catalog-permissions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **If your data store is not publicly accessible** (if your data store limits access from on-premises network, private network or specific IPs, etc.), **you will need to configure a self hosted integration runtime to connect to it**.

- If your data store isn't publicly accessible, set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, see [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md).
    - Ensure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) is installed on the machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed. Restart the machine after you newly install the JDK for it to take effect.
    - Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable (version Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 or newer) is installed on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don't have this update installed, [you can download it here](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

### Required permissions for scan

The PostgreSQL user must have read access to system tables in order to access advanced metadata.

## Register

This section describes how to register PostgreSQL in Microsoft Purview using the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Steps to register

To register a new PostgreSQL source in your data catalog, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Microsoft Purview account in the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).
1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.
1. Select **Register**
1. On Register sources, select **PostgreSQL**. Select **Continue**.

On the **Register sources (PostgreSQL)** screen, follow these steps:

1. Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the Catalog.

1. Enter the **Server** name to connect to a PostgreSQL source. This can either be:
    * A host name used to connect to the database server. For example: `MyDatabaseServer.com`
    * An IP address. For example: `192.169.1.2`

1. Enter the **Port** used to connect to the database server (5432 by default for PostgreSQL).

1. Select a collection or create a new one (Optional)

1. Finish to register the data source.

## Scan

Follow the steps below to scan PostgreSQL to automatically identify assets. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md).

### Authentication for a scan

The supported authentication type for a PostgreSQL source is **Basic authentication**.

### Create and run scan

To create and run a new scan, follow these steps:

1. If your server is publicly accessible, skip to step two. Otherwise, you'll need to make sure your self-hosted integration runtime is configured:
    1. In the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/), got to the Management Center, and select **Integration runtimes**.
    1. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is available. If one isn't set up, use the steps mentioned [here](./manage-integration-runtimes.md) to set up a self-hosted integration runtime.

1. In the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/), navigate to **Sources**.

1. Select the registered PostgreSQL source.

1. Select **+ New scan**.

1. Provide the below details:

    1. **Name**: The name of the scan

    1. **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the Azure auto-resolved integration runtime if your server is publicly accessible, or your configured self-hosted integration runtime if it isn't publicly available.

    1. **Credential**: Select the credential to connect to your data source. Make sure to:
        * Select **Basic Authentication** while creating a credential.
        * Provide the user name used to connect to the database server in the User name input field.
        * Store the user password used to connect to the database server in the secret key.

    1. **Database**： Specify the name of the database instance to import.

    1. **Schema**: List subset of schemas to import expressed as a semicolon separated list. For example, `schema1; schema2`. All user schemas are imported if that list is empty. All system schemas (for example, SysAdmin) and objects are ignored by default.
        
        Acceptable schema name patterns using SQL LIKE expressions syntax include using %. For example: `A%; %B; %C%; D`
        * Start with A or
        * End with B or
        * Contain C or
        * Equal D

        Usage of NOT and special characters aren't acceptable.

    1. **Maximum memory available** (applicable when using self-hosted integration runtime): Maximum memory (in GB) available on customer's VM to be used by scanning processes. This is dependent on the size of PostgreSQL source to be scanned.

        > [!Note]
        > As a rule of thumb, please provide 1GB memory for every 1000 tables

        :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-postgresql/scan.png" alt-text="scan PostgreSQL" border="true":::

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Choose your **scan trigger**. You can set up a schedule or ran the scan once.

1. Review your scan and select **Save and Run**.

## Lineage

After scanning your PostgreSQL source, you can [browse data catalog](how-to-browse-catalog.md) or [search data catalog](how-to-search-catalog.md) to view the asset details. 

Go to the asset -> lineage tab, you can see the asset relationship when applicable. Refer to the [supported capabilities](#supported-capabilities) section on the supported PostgreSQL lineage scenarios. For more information about lineage in general, see [data lineage](concept-data-lineage.md) and [lineage user guide](catalog-lineage-user-guide.md).
