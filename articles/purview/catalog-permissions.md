# Access control in the Microsoft Purview governance portal

The Microsoft Purview governance portal uses **Collections** in the Microsoft Purview Data Map to organize and manage access across its sources, assets, and other artifacts. This article describes collections and access management for your account in the Microsoft Purview governance portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article refers to permissions required for the Microsoft Purview governance portal, and applications like the Microsoft Purview Data Map, Data Catalog, Data Estate Insights, etc. If you are looking for permissions information for the Microsoft Purview compliance center, follow [the article for permissions in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/microsoft-365/compliance/microsoft-365-compliance-center-permissions).

## Collections

A collection is a tool that the Microsoft Purview Data Map uses to group assets, sources, and other artifacts into a hierarchy for discoverability and to manage access control. All accesses to the Microsoft Purview governance portal's resources are managed from collections in the Microsoft Purview Data Map.

## Roles

The Microsoft Purview governance portal uses a set of predefined roles to control who can access what within the account. These roles are currently:

- **Collection administrator** - a role for users that will need to assign roles to other users in the Microsoft Purview governance portal or manage collections. Collection admins can add users to roles on collections where they're admins. They can also edit collections, their details, and add subcollections.
    A collection administrator on the [root collection](reference-azure-purview-glossary.md#root-collection) also automatically has permission to the Microsoft Purview governance portal. If your **root collection administrator** ever needs to be changed, you can [follow the steps in the section below](#administrator-change).
- **Data curators** - a role that provides access to the data catalog to manage assets, configure custom classifications, set up glossary terms, and view data estate insights. Data curators can create, read, modify, move, and delete assets. They can also apply annotations to assets.
- **Data readers** - a role that provides read-only access to data assets, classifications, classification rules, collections and glossary terms.
- **Data source administrator** - a role that allows a user to manage data sources and scans. If a user is granted only to **Data source admin** role on a given data source, they can run new scans using an existing scan rule. To create new scan rules, the user must be also granted as either **Data reader** or **Data curator** roles.
- **Insights reader** - a role that provides read-only access to insights reports for collections where the insights reader also has at least the **Data reader** role. For more information, see [insights permissions.](insights-permissions.md)
- **Policy author (Preview)** - a role that allows a user to view, update, and delete Microsoft Purview policies through the policy management app within Microsoft Purview.
- **Workflow administrator** - a role that allows a user to access the workflow authoring page in the Microsoft Purview governance portal, and publish workflows on collections where they have access permissions. Workflow administrator only has access to authoring, and so will need at least Data reader permission on a collection to be able to access the Purview governance portal.

> [!NOTE] 
> At this time, Microsoft Purview policy author role is not sufficient to create policies. The Microsoft Purview data source admin role is also required.

## Understand how to use the Microsoft Purview governance portal's roles and collections

All access control is managed through collections in the Microsoft Purview Data Map. The collections can be found in the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/). Open your account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the Microsoft Purview governance portal tile on the Overview page. From there, navigate to the data map on the left menu, and then select the 'Collections' tab.

When a Microsoft Purview (formerly Azure Purview) account is created, it starts with a root collection that has the same name as the account itself. The creator of the account is automatically added as a Collection Admin, Data Source Admin, Data Curator, and Data Reader on this root collection, and can edit and manage this collection.

Sources, assets, and objects can be added directly to this root collection, but so can other collections. Adding collections will give you more control over who has access to data across your account.

All other users can only access information within the Microsoft Purview governance portal if they, or a group they're in, are given one of the above roles. This means, when you create an account, no one but the creator can access or use its APIs until they're [added to one or more of the above roles in a collection](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#add-role-assignments).

Users can only be added to a collection by a collection admin, or through permissions inheritance. The permissions of a parent collection are automatically inherited by its subcollections. However, you can choose to [restrict permission inheritance](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#restrict-inheritance) on any collection. If you do this, its subcollections will no longer inherit permissions from the parent and will need to be added directly, though collection admins that are automatically inherited from a parent collection can't be removed.

You can assign roles to users, security groups, and service principals from your Azure Active Directory that is associated with your subscription.

## Assign permissions to your users

After creating a Microsoft Purview (formerly Azure Purview) account, the first thing to do is create collections and assign users to roles within those collections.

> [!NOTE]
> If you created your account using a service principal, to be able to access the Microsoft Purview governance portal and assign permissions to users, you will need to grant a user collection admin permissions on the root collection.
> You can use [this Azure CLI command](/cli/azure/purview/account#az-purview-account-add-root-collection-admin):
>
>   ```azurecli
>   az purview account add-root-collection-admin --account-name [Microsoft Purview Account Name] --resource-group [Resource Group Name] --object-id [User Object Id]
>   ```
>
> The object-id is optional. For more information and an example, see the [CLI command reference page](/cli/azure/purview/account#az-purview-account-add-root-collection-admin).

### Create collections

Collections can be customized for structure of the sources in your Microsoft Purview Data Map, and can act like organized storage bins for these resources. When you're thinking about the collections you might need, consider how your users will access or discover information. Are your sources broken up by departments? Are there specialized groups within those departments that will only need to discover some assets? Are there some sources that should be discoverable by all your users?

This will inform the collections and subcollections you may need to most effectively organize your data map.

New collections can be added directly to the data map where you can choose their parent collection from a drop-down, or they can be added from the parent as a sub collection. In the data map view, you can see all your sources and assets ordered by the collections, and in the list, the source's collection is listed.

For more instructions and information, you can follow our [guide for creating and managing collections](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md).

#### A collections example

Now that we have a base understanding of collections, permissions, and how they work, let's look at an example.

:::image type="content" source="./media/catalog-permissions/collection-example.png" alt-text="Chart showing a sample collections hierarchy broken up by region and department." border="true":::

This is one way an organization might structure their data: Starting with their root collection (Contoso, in this example) collections are organized into regions, and then into departments and subdepartments. Data sources and assets can be added to any one these collections to organize data resources by these regions and department, and manage access control along those lines. There's one subdepartment, Revenue, that has strict access guidelines so permissions will need to be tightly managed.

The [data reader role](#roles) can access information within the catalog, but not manage or edit it. So for our example above, adding the Data Reader permission to a group on the root collection and allowing inheritance will give all users in that group reader permissions on sources and assets in the Microsoft Purview Data Map. This makes these resources discoverable, but not editable, by everyone in that group. [Restricting inheritance](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#restrict-inheritance) on the Revenue group will control access to those assets. Users who need access to revenue information can be added separately to the Revenue collection.
Similarly with the Data Curator and Data Source Admin roles, permissions for those groups will start at the collection where they're assigned and trickle down to subcollections that haven't restricted inheritance. Below we have assigned permissions for several groups at collections levels in the Americas sub collection.

### Add users to roles

Role assignment is managed through the collections. Only a user with the [collection admin role](#roles) can grant permissions to other users on that collection. When new permissions need to be added, a collection admin will access the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/), navigate to data map, then the collections tab, and select the collection where a user needs to be added. From the Role Assignments tab, they'll be able to add and manage users who need permissions.

For full instructions, see our [how-to guide for adding role assignments](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#add-role-assignments).

## Administrator change

There may be a time when your [root collection admin](#roles) needs to change. By default, the user who creates the account is automatically assigned collection admin to the root collection. To update the root collection admin, there are four options:

- You can manage root collection administrators in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/):
    1. Sign in to the Azure portal and search for your Microsoft Purview account.
    1. Select **Root collection permission** from the left-side menu on your Microsoft Purview account page.
    1. Select **Add root collection admin** to add an administrator.
        :::image type="content" source="./media/catalog-permissions/root-collection-admin.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Microsoft Purview account page in the Azure portal with the Root collection permission page selected and the Add root collection admin option highlighted." border="true":::
    1. You can also select **View all root collection admins** to be taken to the root collection in the Microsoft Purview governance portal.

- You can [assign permissions through the Microsoft Purview governance portal](how-to-create-and-manage-collections.md#add-role-assignments) as you have for any other role.

- You can use the REST API to add a collection administrator. Instructions to use the REST API to add a collection admin can be found in our [REST API for collections documentation.](tutorial-metadata-policy-collections-apis.md#add-the-root-collection-administrator-role) For additional information, you can see our [REST API reference](/rest/api/purview/accounts/add-root-collection-admin).

- You can also use [the below Azure CLI command](/cli/azure/purview/account#az-purview-account-add-root-collection-admin). The object-id is optional. For more information and an example, see the [CLI command reference page](/cli/azure/purview/account#az-purview-account-add-root-collection-admin).

    ```azurecli
    az purview account add-root-collection-admin --account-name [Microsoft Purview Account Name] --resource-group [Resource Group Name] --object-id [User Object Id]
    ```
