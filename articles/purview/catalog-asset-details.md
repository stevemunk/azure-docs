# Asset management in the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog

This article discusses how assets are displayed in the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog, and all the features and details available to them. It describes how you can view relevant information or take action on assets in your catalog.

## Prerequisites

- Set up your data sources and scan the assets into your catalog.
- *Or* Use the Microsoft Purview Atlas APIs to ingest assets into the catalog.

## Discover assets

You can discover your assets in the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog by either:
- [Browsing the data catalog](how-to-browse-catalog.md)
- [Searching the data catalog](how-to-search-catalog.md)

Once you've discovered an asset, select it to view the asset details page, which contains all the asset details, and more actions you can take.

## Editing assets

To edit an asset, other than adding a rating, you will need the [data curator](catalog-permissions.md) role on the collection where the asset is housed.

To edit assets you can either:

- Select multiple assets in the catalog to [bulk edit assets](how-to-bulk-edit-assets.md)
- Select a single asset and select the **Edit** button at the top of the [asset details page](#asset-details-page)

#### Scan behavior after editing assets

 Microsoft Purview works to reflect the truth of the source system whenever possible. For example, if you edit a column and later it's deleted from the source table. A scan will remove the column metadata from the asset in Microsoft Purview.

Both column-level and asset-level updates such as adding a description, glossary term or classification don't impact scan updates. Scans will update new columns and classifications regardless if these changes are made.

If you update the **name** or **data type** of a column, subsequent scans **won't** update the asset schema. New columns and classifications **won't** be detected.

## Delete asset

If you're a data curator on the collection containing an asset, you can delete an asset by selecting the delete icon under the name of the asset.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You cannot delete an asset that has child assets.
> 
> Currently, Microsoft Purview doesn't support cascaded deletes. For example, if you attempt to delete a storage account asset in your catalog the containers, folders and files within them will still exist in the data map and the the storage account asset will still exist in relation to them.

Any asset you delete using the delete button is permanently deleted in Microsoft Purview. However, if you run a **full scan** on the source from which the asset was ingested into the catalog, then the asset is reingested and you can discover it using the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog.

If you have a scheduled scan (weekly or monthly) on the source, the **deleted asset won't get re-ingested** into the catalog unless the asset is modified by an end user since the previous run of the scan. For example, say you manually delete a SQL table from the Microsoft Purview Data Map. Later, a data engineer adds a new column to the source table. When Microsoft Purview scans the database, the table will be reingested into the data map and be discoverable in the data catalog.

## Asset details page

At the top of the asset details page there are several tabs:

:::image type="content" source="media/catalog-asset-details/asset-tabs.png" alt-text="Asset details tabs":::

- **Overview** - An asset's basic details like description, classification, hierarchy, and glossary terms.
- **Properties** - The technical metadata and relationships discovered in the data source. 
- **Schema** - The schema of the asset including column names, data types, column level classifications, terms, and descriptions are represented in the schema tab.
- **Lineage** - This tab contains lineage graph details for assets where it's available.
- **Contacts** - Every asset can have an assigned owner and expert that can be viewed and managed from the contacts tab.
- **Related** - This tab lets you navigate through the technical hierarchy of assets that are related to the current asset you're viewing.

## Asset overview

The overview section of the asset details gives a summarized view of an asset. The sections that follow explains the different parts of the overview page.

:::image type="content" source="media/catalog-asset-details/asset-detail-overview.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the asset details overview page.":::

### Asset description

An asset description gives a synopsis of what the asset represents. You can add or update an asset description by [editing the asset](#editing-assets).

#### Adding rich text to a description

Microsoft Purview enables users to add rich formatting to asset descriptions such as adding bolding, underlining, or italicizing text. Users can also create tables, bulleted lists, or hyperlinks to external resources.

:::image type="content" source="media/catalog-asset-details/rich-text-editor.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the rich text editor.":::

Below are the rich text formatting options:

| Name | Description | Shortcut key |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Bold | Make your text bold. Adding the '*' character around text will also bold it.  | Ctrl+B |
| Italic | Italicize your text. Adding the '_' character around text will also italicize it. | Ctrl+I |
| Underline | Underline your text. | Ctrl+U |
| Bullets | Create a bulleted list. Adding the '-' character before text will also create a bulleted list. | |
| Numbering | Create a numbered list Adding the '1' character before text will also create a bulleted list. | | 
| Heading | Add a formatted heading | |
| Font size | Change the size of your text. The default size is 12. | |
| Decrease indent | Move your paragraph closer to the margin. | |
| Increase indent | Move your paragraph farther away from the margin. | |
| Add hyperlink | Create a link in your document for quick access to web pages and files. | | 
| Remove hyperlink | Change a link to plain text. | |
| Quote | Add quote text | |
| Add table | Add a table to your content. | |
| Edit table | Insert or delete a column or row from a table | |
| Clear formatting | Remove all formatting from a selection of text, leaving only the normal, unformatted text. | |
| Undo | Undo changes you made to the content. | Ctrl+Z | 
| Redo | Redo changes you made to the content. | Ctrl+Y | 

> [!NOTE]
> Updating a description with the rich text editor updates the `userDescription` field of an entity. If you have already added an asset description before the release of this feature, that description is stored in the `description` field. When overwriting a plain text description with rich text, the entity model will persist both `userDescription` and `description`. The asset details overview page will only show `userDescription`. The `description` field can't be edited in the Microsoft Purview studio user experience.

### Classifications

Classifications identify the kind of data being represented by an asset or column such as "ABA routing number", "Email Address", or "U.S. Passport number". These attributes can be assigned during scans or added manually. For a full list of classifications, see the [supported classifications in Microsoft Purview](supported-classifications.md). You can see classifications assigned both to the asset and columns in the schema from the overview page.which you can also view as part of the schema.

### Glossary terms

Glossary terms are a managed vocabulary for business terms that can be used to categorize and relate assets across your organization. For more information, see the [business glossary page](concept-business-glossary.md). You can view the assigned glossary terms for an asset in the overview section. If you're a data curator on the asset, you can add or remove a glossary term on an asset by [editing the asset](#editing-assets).

### Collection hierarchy

In Microsoft Purview, collections organize assets and data sources. They also manage access across the Microsoft Purview governance portal. You can view an assets containing collection under the **Collection path** section.

### Asset hierarchy

You can view the full asset hierarchy within the overview tab. As an example: if you navigate to a SQL table, then you can see the schema, database, and the server the table belongs to.

## Asset actions

Below are a list of actions you can take from an asset details page. Actions available to you vary depending on your permissions and the type of asset you're looking at. Available actions are generally available on the global actions bar. 

:::image type="content" source="media/catalog-asset-details/asset-details-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows actions available on the asset details page.":::

### Request access to data

If a [self-service data access workflow](how-to-workflow-self-service-data-access-hybrid.md) has been created, you can request access to a desired asset directly from the asset details page! To learn more about Microsoft Purview's data policy applications, see [how to enable data use management](how-to-enable-data-use-management.md).

## Ratings

Assets can be rated by all users with read access, or better, to that asset in Microsoft Purview.
Ratings allow users to give an asset a rating from 1 to 5 stars, and leave a comment about the asset.

These ratings can be seen by all users with read access, and rating can be [added as a facet](how-to-search-catalog.md#use-the-facets) when [searching the data catalog](how-to-search-catalog.md) so users can find assets with a certain rating.

## Duplicate assets

If you notice duplicate assets in your Microsoft Purview Data Catalog, review the [asset normalization](concept-asset-normalization.md) documentation. Microsoft Purview normalizes assets to prevent duplication, but not all possible scenarios are covered.

Compare the fully qualified asset names for duplicate assets, and update ingestion points to resolve capitalization or character differences. Then, [delete the duplicated asset](#delete-asset) in your catalog.
