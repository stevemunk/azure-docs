#### Region support
- All [Microsoft Purview regions](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=purview) are supported.
- Storage accounts in the following regions are supported without the need for additional configuration. However, zone-redundant storage (ZRS) accounts are not supported.
    - East US
    - East US2
    - South Central US
    - West US2
    - Canada Central
    - North Europe
    - West Europe
    - France Central
    - UK South
    - Southeast Asia
    - Australia East
- Storage accounts in other regions in Public Cloud are supported after setting feature flag *AllowPurviewPolicyEnforcement*, as outlined in the next section. Newly created ZRS Storage accounts are supported, if created after setting the feature flag *AllowPurviewPolicyEnforcement*.


If needed, you can create a new Storage account by [following this guide](../../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

#### Configure the subscription where the Azure Storage account resides for policies from Microsoft Purview
This step is only necessary in certain regions (see prior section). To enable Microsoft Purview to manage policies for one or more Azure Storage accounts, execute the following PowerShell commands in the subscription where you'll deploy your Azure Storage account. These PowerShell commands will enable Microsoft Purview to manage policies on all Azure Storage accounts in that subscription.

If youâ€™re executing these commands locally, be sure to run PowerShell as an administrator.
Alternatively, you can use the [Azure Cloud Shell](../../cloud-shell/overview.md) in the Azure portal: [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com).

```powershell
# Install the Az module
Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
# Login into the subscription
Connect-AzAccount -Subscription <SubscriptionID>
# Register the feature
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName AllowPurviewPolicyEnforcement -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Storage
```

If the output of the last command shows *RegistrationState* as *Registered*, then your subscription is enabled for access policies.
If the output is *Registering*, wait at least 10 minutes, and then retry the command. **Do not continue unless the RegistrationState shows as *Registered***.
