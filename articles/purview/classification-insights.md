## Use Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights for classifications

In Microsoft Purview, classifications are similar to subject tags, and are used to mark and identify data of a specific type that's found within your data estate during scanning.

Microsoft Purview uses the same sensitive information types as Microsoft 365, allowing you to stretch your existing security policies and protection across your entire data estate.

> [!NOTE]
> After you have scanned your source types, give **classification insights** a couple of hours to reflect the new assets.

**To view classification insights:**

1. Go to the **Microsoft Purview** [instance screen in the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/purviewportal) and select your Microsoft Purview account.

1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Get Started** section, select the **Microsoft Purview governance portal** tile.

1. In Microsoft Purview, select the **Data Estate Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: menu item on the left to access your **Data Estate Insights** area.
