# Sensitivity label insights about your data in Microsoft Purview

This how-to guide describes how to access, view, and filter security insights provided by sensitivity labels applied to your data.

Supported data sources include: Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) GEN 1, Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) GEN 2, SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon RDS databases (public preview), Power BI

In this how-to guide, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Launch your Microsoft Purview account from Azure.
> - View sensitivity labeling insights on your data
> - Drill down for more sensitivity labeling details on your data

 
## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights, make sure that you've completed the following steps:

- Set up your Azure resources and populated the relevant accounts with test data

- [Extended sensitivity labels to assets in the Microsoft Purview Data Map](how-to-automatically-label-your-content.md), and created or selected the labels you want to apply to your data.

- Set up and completed a scan on the test data in each data source. For more information, see [Manage data sources in Microsoft Purview](manage-data-sources.md) and [Create a scan rule set](create-a-scan-rule-set.md).

- Signed in to Microsoft Purview with account with a [Data Reader or Data Curator role](catalog-permissions.md#roles).

For more information, see [Manage data sources in Microsoft Purview](manage-data-sources.md) and [Automatically label your data in Microsoft Purview](create-sensitivity-label.md).

## Use Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights for sensitivity labels

Classifications are similar to subject tags, and are used to mark and identify data of a specific type that's found within your data estate during scanning.

Sensitivity labels enable you to state how sensitive certain data is in your organization. For example, a specific project name might be highly confidential within your organization, while that same term is not confidential to other organizations. 

Classifications are matched directly, such as a social security number, which has a classification of **Social Security Number**. 

In contrast, sensitivity labels are applied when one or more classifications and conditions are found together. In this context, [conditions](/microsoft-365/compliance/apply-sensitivity-label-automatically) refer to all the parameters that you can define for unstructured data, such as **proximity to another classification**, and **% confidence**. 

Microsoft Purview Data Estate Insights uses the same classifications, also known as [sensitive information types](/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitive-information-type-entity-definitions), as those used with Microsoft 365 apps and services. This enables you to extend your existing sensitivity labels to assets in the data map.

> [!NOTE]
> After you have scanned your source types, give **Sensitivity labeling** Insights a couple of hours to reflect the new assets.

**To view sensitivity labeling insights:**

1. Go to the **Microsoft Purview** home page.

1. On the **Overview** page, in the **Get Started** section, select the **Launch Microsoft Purview account** tile.

1. In Microsoft Purview, select the **Data Estate Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: menu item on the left to access your **Data Estate Insights** area.

1. In the **Data Estate Insights** :::image type="icon" source="media/insights/ico-insights.png" border="false"::: area, select **Sensitivity labels** to display the Microsoft Purview **Sensitivity labeling insights** report.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this report is empty, you may not have extended your sensitivity labels to Microsoft Purview Data Map. For more information, see [Labeling in the Microsoft Purview Data Map](create-sensitivity-label.md).

## Sensitivity label integration with Microsoft Purview Information Protection

Close integration with [Microsoft Purview Information Protection](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-protection) means that you have direct ways to extend visibility into your data estate, and classify and label your data.

For sensitivity labels to be extended to your assets in the data map, you must actively turn on this capability in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

For more information, see [How to automatically apply sensitivity labels to your data in the Microsoft Purview Data Map](how-to-automatically-label-your-content.md).
