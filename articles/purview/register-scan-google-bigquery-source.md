# Connect to and manage Google BigQuery projects in Microsoft Purview

This article outlines how to register Google BigQuery projects, and how to authenticate and interact with Google BigQuery in Microsoft Purview. For more information about Microsoft Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Labeling**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|**Data Sharing**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register)| [Yes](#scan)| No | [Yes](#scan) | No | No| No| [Yes](#lineage)| No |


When scanning Google BigQuery source, Microsoft Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Projects
    - Datasets
    - Tables including the columns
    - Views including the columns

- Fetching static lineage on assets relationships among tables and views.

When setting up scan, you can choose to scan an entire Google BigQuery project, or scope the scan to a subset of datasets matching the given name(s) or name pattern(s).

### Known limitations

- Currently, Microsoft Purview only supports scanning Google BigQuery datasets in US multi-regional location. If the specified dataset is in other location e.g. us-east1 or EU, you will observe scan completes but no assets shown up in Microsoft Purview.
- When object is deleted from the data source, currently the subsequent scan won't automatically remove the corresponding asset in Microsoft Purview.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Microsoft Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You need Data Source Administrator and Data Reader permissions to register a source and manage it in the Microsoft Purview governance portal. For more information about permissions, see [Access control in Microsoft Purview](catalog-permissions.md).

* Set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, see [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md).

    * Ensure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) is installed on the machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed. Restart the machine after you newly install the JDK for it to take effect.

    * Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable (version Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 or newer) is installed on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don't have this update installed, [you can download it here](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

    * Download and unzip the [BigQuery JDBC driver](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/providers/simba-drivers) on the machine where your self-hosted integration runtime is running. Note down the folder path which you will use to set up the scan.

        > [!Note]
        > The driver should be accessible by the self-hosted integration runtime. By default, self-hosted integration runtime uses [local service account "NT SERVICE\DIAHostService"](manage-integration-runtimes.md#service-account-for-self-hosted-integration-runtime). Make sure it has "Read and execute" and "List folder contents" permission to the driver folder.

## Register

This section describes how to register a Google BigQuery project in Microsoft Purview using the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Steps to register

1. Open the Microsoft Purview governance portal by:

    - Browsing directly to [https://web.purview.azure.com](https://web.purview.azure.com) and selecting your Microsoft Purview account.
    - Opening the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), searching for and selecting the Microsoft Purview account. Selecting the [**the Microsoft Purview governance portal**](https://web.purview.azure.com/) button.
1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.
1. Select **Register.**
1. On Register sources, select **Google BigQuery** . Select **Continue.**

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-google-bigquery-source/register-sources.png" alt-text="register BigQuery source" border="true":::

On the Register sources (Google BigQuery) screen, do the following:

1. Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the Catalog.

1. Enter the **ProjectID.** This should be a fully qualified project ID. For example, mydomain.com:myProject

1. Select a collection or create a new one (Optional)

1. Select **Register**.

## Scan

Follow the steps below to scan a Google BigQuery project to automatically identify assets. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md).

### Create and run scan

1. In the Management Center, select Integration runtimes. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is set up. If it isn't set up, use the steps mentioned [here](./manage-integration-runtimes.md).

1. Navigate to **Sources**.

1. Select the registered **BigQuery** project.

1. Select **+ New scan**.

1. Provide the below details:

    1. **Name**: The name of the scan

    1. **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the configured self-hosted integration runtime

    1. **Credential**: While configuring BigQuery credential, make sure to:

        * Select **Basic Authentication** as the Authentication method
        * Provide the email ID of the service account in the User name field. For example, `xyz\@developer.gserviceaccount.com`
        * Follow below steps to generate the private key, copy the entire JSON key file then store it as the value of a Key Vault secret.

        To create a new private key from Google's cloud platform:
        1. In the navigation menu, select IAM & Admin -\> Service Accounts -\> Select a project -\> 
        1. Select the email address of the service account that you want to create a key for.
        1. Select the **Keys** tab.
        1. Select the **Add key** drop-down menu, then select Create new key. 
        1. Choose JSON format.

          > [!Note]
          > The contents of the private key are saved in a temp file on the VM when scanning processes are running. This temp file is deleted after the scans are successfully completed. In the event of a scan failure, the system will continue to retry until success. Please make sure access is appropriately restricted on the VM where SHIR is running.

        To understand more on credentials, refer to the link [here](manage-credentials.md).

    1. **Driver location**: Specify the path to the JDBC driver location in your machine where self-host integration runtime is running, e.g. `D:\Drivers\GoogleBigQuery`. It's the path to valid JAR folder location. Make sure the driver is accessible by the self-hosted integration runtime, learn more from [prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

    1. **Dataset**: Specify a list of BigQuery datasets to import.
        For example, dataset1; dataset2. When the list is empty, all available datasets are imported.
        Acceptable dataset name patterns using SQL LIKE expressions syntax include using %.

        Example:
        A%; %B; %C%; D
        * Start with A or
        * end with B or
        * contain C or
        * equal D

        Usage of NOT and special characters aren't acceptable.

    1. **Maximum memory available**: Maximum memory (in GB) available on your VM to be used by scanning processes. This is dependent on the size of Google BigQuery project to be scanned.

        :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-google-bigquery-source/scan.png" alt-text="scan BigQuery source" border="true":::

1. Select **Test connection.**

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Choose your **scan trigger**. You can set up a schedule or ran the
    scan once.

1. Review your scan and select **Save and Run**.

## Lineage

After scanning your Google BigQuery source, you can [browse data catalog](how-to-browse-catalog.md) or [search data catalog](how-to-search-catalog.md) to view the asset details. 

Go to the asset -> lineage tab, you can see the asset relationship when applicable. Refer to the [supported capabilities](#supported-capabilities) section on the supported Google BigQuery lineage scenarios. For more information about lineage in general, see [data lineage](concept-data-lineage.md) and [lineage user guide](catalog-lineage-user-guide.md).
