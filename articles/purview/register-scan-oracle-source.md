# Connect to and manage Oracle in Microsoft Purview

This article outlines how to register Oracle, and how to authenticate and interact with Oracle in Microsoft Purview. For more information about Microsoft Purview, read the [introductory article](overview.md).

## Supported capabilities

|**Metadata Extraction**|  **Full Scan**  |**Incremental Scan**|**Scoped Scan**|**Classification**|**Labeling**|**Access Policy**|**Lineage**|**Data Sharing**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Yes](#register)| [Yes](#scan)| No | [Yes](#scan) | [Yes](#scan) | No |No| [Yes*](#lineage)| No |

\* *Besides the lineage on assets within the data source, lineage is also supported if dataset is used as a source/sink in [Data Factory](how-to-link-azure-data-factory.md) or [Synapse pipeline](how-to-lineage-azure-synapse-analytics.md).*

The supported Oracle server versions are 6i to 19c. Oracle proxy server isn't supported when scanning Oracle source.

When scanning Oracle source, Microsoft Purview supports:

- Extracting technical metadata including:

    - Server
    - Schemas
    - Packages
    - Tables including the columns, foreign keys, indexes, triggers and unique constraints
    - Views including the columns and triggers
    - Stored procedures including the parameter dataset and result set
    - Functions including the parameter dataset
    - Sequences
    - Synonyms
    - Types including the type attributes

- Fetching static lineage on assets relationships among tables and views.

When setting up scan, you can choose to scan an entire Oracle server, or scope the scan to a subset of schemas matching the given name(s) or name pattern(s).

### Known limitations

- Currently, the Oracle service name isn't captured in the metadata or hierarchy.
- When object is deleted from the data source, currently the subsequent scan won't automatically remove the corresponding asset in Microsoft Purview.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Microsoft Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You need Data Source Administrator and Data Reader permissions to register a source and manage it in the Microsoft Purview governance portal. For more information about permissions, see [Access control in Microsoft Purview](catalog-permissions.md).

* Set up the latest [self-hosted integration runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). For more information, seeÂ [the create and configure a self-hosted integration runtime guide](manage-integration-runtimes.md).

    * Ensure [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) is installed on the machine where the self-hosted integration runtime is installed. Restart the machine after you newly install the JDK for it to take effect.

    * Ensure Visual C++ Redistributable (version Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 or newer) is installed on the self-hosted integration runtime machine. If you don't have this update installed, [you can download it here](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

    * Download the [Oracle JDBC driver](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html) on the machine where your self-hosted integration runtime is running. Note down the folder path that you'll use to set up the scan.

        > [!Note]
        > The driver should be accessible by the self-hosted integration runtime. By default, self-hosted integration runtime uses [local service account "NT SERVICE\DIAHostService"](manage-integration-runtimes.md#service-account-for-self-hosted-integration-runtime). Make sure it has "Read and execute" and "List folder contents" permission to the driver folder.

### Required permissions for scan

Microsoft Purview supports basic authentication (username and password) for scanning Oracle. The Oracle user must have read access to system tables in order to access advanced metadata. 

For classification, user also needs to be the owner of the table.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If the user is not the owner of the table, the scan will run successfully and ingest metadata, but will not identify any classifications.

The user should have permission to create a session and role SELECT\_CATALOG\_ROLE assigned. Alternatively, the user may have SELECT permission granted for every individual system table that this connector queries metadata from:

```sql
grant create session to [user];
grant select on all_users to [user];
grant select on dba_objects to [user];
grant select on dba_tab_comments to [user];
grant select on dba_external_locations to [user];
grant select on dba_directories to [user];
grant select on dba_mviews to [user];
grant select on dba_clu_columns to [user];
grant select on dba_tab_columns to [user];
grant select on dba_col_comments to [user];
grant select on dba_constraints to [user];
grant select on dba_cons_columns to [user];
grant select on dba_indexes to [user];
grant select on dba_ind_columns to [user];
grant select on dba_procedures to [user];
grant select on dba_synonyms to [user];
grant select on dba_views to [user];
grant select on dba_source to [user];
grant select on dba_triggers to [user];
grant select on dba_arguments to [user];
grant select on dba_sequences to [user];
grant select on dba_dependencies to [user];
grant select on dba_type_attrs to [user];
grant select on V_$INSTANCE to [user];
grant select on v_$database to [user];
```

## Register

This section describes how to register Oracle in Microsoft Purview using the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Steps to register

To register a new Oracle source in your data catalog, do the following:

1. Navigate to your Microsoft Purview account in the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/resource/).
1. Select **Data Map** on the left navigation.
1. Select **Register**
1. On Register sources, select **Oracle**. Select **Continue**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-oracle-source/register-sources.png" alt-text="register sources" border="true":::

On the **Register sources (Oracle)** screen, do the following:

1. Enter a **Name** that the data source will be listed within the Catalog.

1. Enter the **Host** name to connect to an Oracle source. This can either be:
    * A host name used to connect to the database server. For example: `MyDatabaseServer.com`
    * An IP address. For example: `192.169.1.2`

1. Enter the **Port number** used to connect to the database server (1521 by default for Oracle).

1. Enter the **Oracle service name** (not Oracle UID) used to connect to the database server.

1. Select a collection or create a new one (Optional)

1. Finish to register the data source.

## Scan

Follow the steps below to scan Oracle to automatically identify assets. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md).

> [!TIP]
> To troubleshoot any issues with scanning:
> 1. Confirm you have followed all [**prerequisites**](#prerequisites).
> 1. Review our [**scan troubleshooting documentation**](troubleshoot-connections.md).

### Create and run scan

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1. In the Management Center, select Integration runtimes. Make sure a self-hosted integration runtime is set up. If it isn't set up, use the steps mentioned [here](./manage-integration-runtimes.md) to create a self-hosted integration runtime.

1. Navigate to **Sources**.

1. Select the registered Oracle source.

1. Select **+ New scan**.

1. Provide the below details:

    1. **Name**: The name of the scan

    1. **Connect via integration runtime**: Select the configured
        self-hosted integration runtime

    1. **Credential**: Select the credential to connect to your data source. Make sure to:
        * Select Basic Authentication while creating a credential.
        * Provide the user name used to connect to the database server in the User name input field.
        * Store the user password used to connect to the database server in the secret key.

    1. **Schema**: List subset of schemas to import expressed as a semicolon separated list in **case-sensitive** manner. For example, `schema1; schema2`. All user schemas are imported if that list is empty. All system schemas (for example, SysAdmin) and objects are ignored by default.

        Acceptable schema name patterns using SQL LIKE expressions syntax include using %. For example: `A%; %B; %C%; D`
        * Start with A or
        * End with B or
        * Contain C or
        * Equal D

        Usage of NOT and special characters aren't acceptable.

    1. **Driver location**: Specify the path to the JDBC driver location in your machine where self-host integration runtime is running, for example, `D:\Drivers\Oracle`. It's the path to valid JAR folder location. Make sure the driver is accessible by the self-hosted integration runtime, learn more from [prerequisites section](#prerequisites).

    1. **Stored procedure details**: Controls the number of details imported from stored procedures:

        - Signature: The name and parameters of stored procedures.
        - Code, signature: The name, parameters and code of stored procedures.
        - Lineage, code, signature: The name, parameters and code of stored procedures, and the data lineage derived from the code.
        - None: Stored procedure details aren't included.

    1. **Maximum memory available**: Maximum memory (in GB) available on customer's VM to be used by scanning processes. This is dependent on the size of Oracle source to be scanned.

        > [!Note]
        > As a rule of thumb, please provide 1GB memory for every 1000 tables

        :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-oracle-source/scan.png" alt-text="scan oracle" border="true":::

1. Select **Test connection**.

    > [!Note]
    > Use the "Test connection" button in the scan setup UI to test the connection. The "Test Connection" in self-hosted integration runtime configuration manager UI -> Diagnostics tab does not fully validate the connectivity.

1. Select **Continue**.

1. Select a **scan rule set** for classification. You can choose between the system default, existing custom rule sets, or [create a new rule set](create-a-scan-rule-set.md) inline.

1. Choose your **scan trigger**. You can set up a schedule or ran the scan once.

1. Review your scan and select **Save and Run**.
