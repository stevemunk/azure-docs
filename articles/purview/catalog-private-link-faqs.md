# FAQ about Microsoft Purview private endpoints and Managed VNets

This article answers common questions that customers and field teams often ask about Microsoft Purview network configurations by using [Azure Private Link](../private-link/private-link-overview.md) or [Microsoft Purview Managed VNets](./catalog-managed-vnet.md). It's intended to clarify questions about Microsoft Purview firewall settings, private endpoints, DNS configuration, and related configurations.

To set up Microsoft Purview by using Private Link, see [Use private endpoints for your Microsoft Purview account](./catalog-private-link.md).
To configure Managed VNets for a Microsoft Purview account, see [Use a Managed VNet with your Microsoft Purview account](./catalog-managed-vnet.md) 

## Common questions

Check out the answers to the following common questions.

### When should I use a self-hosted integration runtime or a Managed IR?

Use a Managed IR if:
- Your Microsoft Purview account is deployed in one of the [supported regions for Managed VNets](catalog-managed-vnet.md#supported-regions).
- You are planning to scan any of the [supported data sources](catalog-managed-vnet.md#supported-data-sources) by Managed IR.

Use a self-hosted integration runtime if:
- You are planning to scan data sources in Azure IaaS, SaaS services behind private network or in your on-premises network.
- Managed VNet is not available in the region where your Microsoft Purview account is deployed.
- You are planning to scan any sources that are not listed under [Managed VNet IR supported sources](catalog-managed-vnet.md#supported-data-sources). 

### Can I use both self-hosted integration runtime and Managed IR inside a Microsoft Purview account?

Yes. You can use one or all of the runtime options in a single Microsoft Purview account: Azure IR, Managed IR and self-hosted integration runtime. You can use only one runtime option in a single scan.

### What's the purpose of deploying the Microsoft Purview account private endpoint?

The Microsoft Purview account private endpoint is used to add another layer of security by enabling scenarios where only client calls that originate from within the virtual network are allowed to access the account. This private endpoint is also a prerequisite for the portal private endpoint.

### What's the purpose of deploying the Microsoft Purview portal private endpoint?

The Microsoft Purview portal private endpoint provides private connectivity to the Microsoft Purview governance portal.

### What's the purpose of deploying the Microsoft Purview ingestion private endpoints?

Microsoft Purview can scan data sources in Azure or an on-premises environment by using ingestion private endpoints. Three other private endpoint resources are deployed and linked to Microsoft Purview managed or configured resources when ingestion private endpoints are created:

- **Blob** is linked to a Microsoft Purview managed storage account.
- **Queue** is linked to a Microsoft Purview managed storage account.
- **namespace** is linked to a Microsoft Purview configured event hub namespace.

### Can I scan a data source through a public endpoint if a private endpoint is enabled on my Microsoft Purview account?

Yes. Data sources that aren't connected through a private endpoint can be scanned by using a public endpoint while Microsoft Purview is configured to use a private endpoint.

### Can I scan a data source through a service endpoint if a private endpoint is enabled?

Yes. Data sources that aren't connected through a private endpoint can be scanned by using a service endpoint while Microsoft Purview is configured to use a private endpoint.

Make sure you enable **Allow trusted Microsoft services** to access the resources inside the service endpoint configuration of the data source resource in Azure. For example, if you're going to scan Azure Blob Storage in which the firewalls and virtual networks settings are set to **selected networks**, make sure the **Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account** checkbox is selected as an exception.

### Can I scan a data source through a public endpoint using Managed IR?

Yes. If data source is supported by Managed VNet. As a prerequisite, you need to deploy a managed private endpoint for the data source.

### Can I scan a data source through a service endpoint using Managed IR?

Yes. If data source is supported by Managed VNet. As a prerequisite, you need to deploy a managed private endpoint for the data source.

### Can I access the Microsoft Purview governance portal from a public network if Public network access is set to Deny in Microsoft Purview account networking?

No. Connecting to Microsoft Purview from a public endpoint where **Public network access** is set to **Deny** results in the following error message:

"Not authorized to access this Microsoft Purview account. This Microsoft Purview account is behind a private endpoint. Please access the account from a client in the same virtual network (VNet) that has been configured for the Microsoft Purview account's private endpoint."

In this case, to open the Microsoft Purview governance portal, either use a machine that's deployed in the same virtual network as the Microsoft Purview portal private endpoint or use a VM that's connected to your CorpNet in which hybrid connectivity is allowed.

### Is it possible to restrict access to the Microsoft Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace (for private endpoint ingestion only) but keep portal access enabled for users across the web?

Yes. You can configure Microsoft Purview firewall setting to Disabled for ingestion only (Preview). By choosing this option, public network access to your Microsoft Purview account through API and Microsoft Purview governance portal is allowed, however public network access is set to disabled on your Microsoft Purview account's Managed storage account and event hub.

### If public network access is set to Allow, does it mean the managed storage account and event hub namespace are accessible by anyone?

No. As protected resources, access to the Microsoft Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace is restricted to Microsoft Purview only using RBAC authenitcation schemes. These resources are deployed with a deny assignment to all principals, which prevents any applications, users, or groups from gaining access to them.

To read more about Azure deny assignment, see [Understand Azure deny assignments](../role-based-access-control/deny-assignments.md).

### What are the supported authentication types when I use a private endpoint?

Depends on authentication type supported by the data source type such as SQL Authentication, Windows Authentication, Basic Authentication, Service Principal, etc. stored in Azure Key Vault. MSI cannot be used.

### What are the supported authentication types when I use Managed IR?
Depends on authentication type supported by the data source type such as SQL Authentication, Windows Authentication, Basic Authentication, Service Principal, etc. stored in Azure Key Vault or MSI.

### What private DNS zones are required for Microsoft Purview for a private endpoint?

For Microsoft Purview _account_ and _portal_ private endpoints:

- `privatelink.purview.azure.com`

For Microsoft Purview _ingestion_ private endpoints:

- `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net`
- `privatelink.queue.core.windows.net`
- `privatelink.servicebus.windows.net`

### Do I have to use a dedicated virtual network and dedicated subnet when I deploy Microsoft Purview private endpoints?

No. However, `PrivateEndpointNetworkPolicies` must be disabled in the destination subnet before you deploy the private endpoints. Consider deploying Microsoft Purview into a virtual network that has network connectivity to data source virtual networks through VNet Peering and access to an on-premises network if you plan to scan data sources cross-premises.

Read more about [Disable network policies for private endpoints](../private-link/disable-private-endpoint-network-policy.md).

### Can I deploy Microsoft Purview private endpoints and use existing private DNS zones in my subscription to register the A records?

Yes. Your private endpoint DNS zones can be centralized in a hub or data management subscription for all internal DNS zones required for Microsoft Purview and all data source records. We recommend this method to allow Microsoft Purview to resolve data sources by using their private endpoint internal IP addresses.

You're also required to set up a [virtual network link](../dns/private-dns-virtual-network-links.md) for virtual networks for the existing private DNS zone.

### Can I use Azure integration runtime to scan data sources through a private endpoint?

No. You have to deploy and register a self-hosted integration runtime to scan data by using private connectivity. Azure Key Vault or Service Principal must be used as the authentication method to data sources.

### Can I use Managed IR to scan data sources through a private endpoint?

If you are planning to use Managed IR to scan any of the supported data sources, the data source requires a managed private endpoint created inside Microsoft Purview Managed VNet. For more information, see [Microsoft Purview Managed VNets](./catalog-managed-vnet.md).

### What are the outbound ports and firewall requirements for virtual machines with self-hosted integration runtime for Microsoft Purview when you use a private endpoint?

The VMs in which self-hosted integration runtime is deployed must have outbound access to Azure endpoints and a Microsoft Purview private IP address through port 443.

### Do I need to enable outbound internet access from the virtual machine running self-hosted integration runtime if a private endpoint is enabled?

No. However, it's expected that the virtual machine running self-hosted integration runtime can connect to your instance of Microsoft Purview through an internal IP address by using port 443. Use common troubleshooting tools for name resolution and connectivity testing, such as nslookup.exe and Test-NetConnection.

### Do I still need to deploy private endpoints for my Microsoft Purview account if I am using Managed VNet?

At least one account and portal private endpoints are required, if public access in Microsoft Purview account is set to **deny**.
At least one account, portal and ingestion private endpoint are required, if public access in Microsoft Purview account is set to **deny** and you are planning to scan additional data sources using a self-hosted integration runtime.

### What inbound and outbound communications are allowed through public endpoint for Microsoft Purview Managed VNets?

No inbound communication is allowed into a Managed VNet from public network.
All ports are opened for outbound communications.
In Microsoft Purview, a Managed VNet can be used to privately connect to Azure data sources to extract metadata during scan.

### Why do I receive the following error message when I try to launch Microsoft Purview governance portal from my machine?

"This Microsoft Purview account is behind a private endpoint. Please access the account from a client in the same virtual network (VNet) that has been configured for the Microsoft Purview account's private endpoint."

It's likely your Microsoft Purview account is deployed by using Private Link and public access is disabled on your Microsoft Purview account. As a result, you have to browse the Microsoft Purview governance portal from a virtual machine that has internal network connectivity to Microsoft Purview.

If you're connecting from a VM behind a hybrid network or using a jump machine connected to your virtual network, use common troubleshooting tools for name resolution and connectivity testing, such as nslookup.exe and Test-NetConnection.

1. Validate if you can resolve the following addresses through your Microsoft Purview account's private IP addresses.

   - `Web.Purview.Azure.com`
   - `<YourPurviewAccountName>.Purview.Azure.com`

1. Verify network connectivity to your Microsoft Purview account by using the following PowerShell command:

   ```powershell
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <YourPurviewAccountName>.Purview.Azure.com -Port 443
   ```

1. Verify your cross-premises DNS configuration if you use your own DNS resolution infrastructure.

For more information about DNS settings for private endpoints, see [Azure private endpoint DNS configuration](../private-link/private-endpoint-dns.md).

## Can I move private endpoints associated with Microsoft Purview account or its managed resources to another Azure subscription or resource group?

No. Move operations for Account, Portal or Ingestion private endpoints are not supported. For more information, see [Move networking resources to new resource group or subscription](../azure-resource-manager/management/move-limitations/networking-move-limitations.md#private-endpoints).
