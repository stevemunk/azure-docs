## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

* An active [Microsoft Purview account](create-catalog-portal.md).

* You'll need to be a Data Source Administrator and Data Reader to register a source and manage it in the Microsoft Purview governance portal. See our [Microsoft Purview Permissions page](catalog-permissions.md) for details.

## Register

This section describes how to register multiple Azure sources in Microsoft Purview using the [Microsoft Purview governance portal](https://web.purview.azure.com/).

### Prerequisites for registration

Microsoft Purview needs permissions to be able to list resources under a subscription or resource group.

[!INCLUDE [Permissions to list resources](./includes/authentication-to-enumerate-resources.md)]

### Authentication for registration

There are two ways to set up authentication for multiple sources in Azure:

* Managed identity
* Service principal

You must set up authentication on each resource within your subscription or resource group that you want to register and scan. Azure Storage resource types (Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2) make it easy by allowing you to add the MSI file or service principal at the subscription or resource group level as a storage blob data reader. The permissions then trickle down to each storage account within that subscription or resource group. For all other resource types, you must apply the MSI file or service principal on each resource, or create a script to do so.

To learn how to add permissions on each resource type within a subscription or resource group, see the following resources:
    
- [Azure Blob Storage](register-scan-azure-blob-storage-source.md#authentication-for-a-scan)
- [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1](register-scan-adls-gen1.md#authentication-for-a-scan)
- [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](register-scan-adls-gen2.md#authentication-for-a-scan)
- [Azure SQL Database](register-scan-azure-sql-database.md#configure-authentication-for-a-scan)
- [Azure SQL Managed Instance](register-scan-azure-sql-managed-instance.md#authentication-for-registration)
- [Azure Synapse Analytics](register-scan-azure-synapse-analytics.md#authentication-for-registration)

### Steps to register

1. Open the Microsoft Purview governance portal by:

    - Browsing directly to [https://web.purview.azure.com](https://web.purview.azure.com) and selecting your Microsoft Purview account.
    - Opening the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), searching for and selecting the Microsoft Purview account. Selecting the [**the Microsoft Purview governance portal**](https://web.purview.azure.com/) button.
1. Select **Data Map** on the left menu.
1. Select **Register**.
1. On **Register sources**, select **Azure (multiple)**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-multiple-sources/register-azure-multiple.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the tile for Azure Multiple on the screen for registering multiple sources.":::

1. Select **Continue**.
1. On the **Register sources (Azure)** screen, do the following:

   1. In the **Name** box, enter a name that the data source will be listed with in the catalog. 
   1. In the **Management group** box, optionally choose a management group to filter down to.
   1. In the **Subscription** and **Resource group** dropdown list boxes, select a subscription or a specific resource group, respectively. The registration scope will be set to the selected subscription or resource group.  

      :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-multiple-sources/azure-multiple-source-setup.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the boxes for selecting a subscription and resource group.":::

   1. In the **Select a collection** box, select a collection or create a new one (optional).
   1. Select **Register** to register the data sources.

## Scan

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, scanning multiple Azure sources is only supported using Azure integration runtime, therefore, only Microsoft Purview accounts that allow public access on the firewall can use this option.

Follow the steps below to scan multiple Azure sources to automatically identify assets and classify your data. For more information about scanning in general, see our [introduction to scans and ingestion](concept-scans-and-ingestion.md).

### Create and run scan

To create and run a new scan, do the following:

1. Select the **Data Map** tab on the left pane in the Microsoft Purview governance portal.
1. Select the data source that you registered.
1. Select **View details** > **+ New scan**, or use the **Scan** quick-action icon on the source tile.
1. For **Name**, fill in the name.
1. For **Type**, select the types of resources that you want to scan within this source. Choose one of these options:

    - Leave it as **All**. This selection includes future resource types that might not currently exist within that subscription or resource group.
    - Use the boxes to specifically select resource types that you want to scan. If you choose this option, future resource types that might be created within this subscription or resource group won't be included for scans, unless the scan is explicitly edited in the future.

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-multiple-sources/multiple-source-scan.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows options for scanning multiple sources.":::

1. Select the credential to connect to the resources within your data source:
    - You can select a credential at the parent level as an MSI file, or you can select a credential for a particular service principal type. You can then use that credential for all the resource types under the subscription or resource group.
    - You can specifically select the resource type and apply a different credential for that resource type.

    Each credential will be considered as the method of authentication for all the resources under a particular type. You must set the chosen credential on the resources in order to successfully scan them, as described [earlier in this article](#authentication-for-registration).
1. Within each type, you can select to either scan all the resources or scan a subset of them by name:
    - If you leave the option as **All**, then future resources of that type will also be scanned in future scan runs.
    - If you select specific storage accounts or SQL databases, then future resources of that type created within this subscription or resource group won't be included for scans, unless the scan is explicitly edited in the future.

1. Select **Test connection**. This will first test access to check if you've applied the Microsoft Purview MSI file as a reader on the subscription or resource group. If you get an error message, follow [these instructions](#prerequisites-for-registration) to resolve it. Then it will test your authentication and connection to each of your selected sources and generate a report. The number of sources selected will impact the time it takes to generate this report. If failed on some resources, hovering over the **X** icon will display the detailed error message.

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-multiple-sources/test-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the scan setup slider, with the Test Connection button highlighted.":::
    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-multiple-sources/test-connection-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing an example test connection report, with some connections passing and some failing. Hovering over one of the failed connections shows a detailed error report.":::

1. After your test connection has passed, select **Continue** to proceed.

1. Select scan rule sets for each resource type that you chose in the previous step. You can also create scan rule sets inline.
  
   :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-multiple-sources/multiple-scan-rule-set.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows scan rules for each resource type.":::

1. Choose your scan trigger. You can schedule it to run weekly, monthly, or once.

1. Review your scan and select **Save** to complete setup.

## View your scans and scan runs

1. View source details by selecting **View details** on the tile under the **Data Map** section.

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-multiple-sources/multiple-source-detail.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows source details."::: 

1. View scan run details by going to the **Scan details** page.
   
    The *status bar* is a brief summary of the running status of the child resources. It's displayed on the subscription level or resource group level. The colors have the following meanings:
    
    - Green: The scan was successful.
    - Red: The scan failed. 
    - Gray: The scan is still in progress.
   
    You can select each scan to view finer details.

    :::image type="content" source="media/register-scan-azure-multiple-sources/multiple-scan-full-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows scan details.":::

1. View a summary of recent failed scan runs at the bottom of the source details. You can also view more granular details about these runs.

## Manage your scans: edit, delete, or cancel

To manage a scan, do the following:

1. Go to the management center.
1. Select **Data sources** under the **Sources and scanning** section, and then select the desired data source.
1. Select the scan that you want to manage. Then: 

   - You can edit the scan by selecting **Edit**.
   - You can delete the scan by selecting **Delete**.
   - If the scan is running, you can cancel it by selecting **Cancel**.

## Access Policy

### Supported policies
The following types of policies are supported on this data resource from Microsoft Purview:
- [DevOps policies](concept-policies-devops.md)
- [Data owner policies](concept-policies-data-owner.md)


### Access policy pre-requisites on Azure Storage accounts
To be able to enforce policies from Microsoft Purview, data sources under a resource group or subscription need to be configured first. Instructions vary based on the data source type.
Please review whether they support Microsoft Purview policies, and if so, the specific instructions to enable them, under the Access Policy link in the [Microsoft Purview connector document](./microsoft-purview-connector-overview.md).

### Configure the Microsoft Purview account for policies
[!INCLUDE [Access policies generic configuration](./includes/access-policies-configuration-generic.md)]

### Register the data source in Microsoft Purview for Data Use Management
The Azure subscription or resource group needs to be registered first with Microsoft Purview before you can create access policies.
To register your resource, follow the **Prerequisites** and **Register** sections of this guide:
-   [Register multiple sources in Microsoft Purview](register-scan-azure-multiple-sources.md#prerequisites)

After you've registered the data resource, you'll need to enable Data Use Management. This is a pre-requisite before you can create policies on the data resource. Data Use Management can impact the security of your data, as it delegates to certain Microsoft Purview roles managing access to the data sources. **Go through the secure practices related to Data Use Management in this guide**: [How to enable Data Use Management](./how-to-enable-data-use-management.md) 

Once your data source has the  **Data Use Management** option set to **Enabled**, it will look like this screenshot:
![Screenshot shows how to register a data source for policy with the option Data use management set to enable.](./media/how-to-policies-data-owner-resource-group/register-resource-group-for-policy.png)

### Create a policy
To create an access policy on an entire Azure subscription or resource group, follow these guides:
* [DevOps policy covering all sources in a subscription or resource group](./how-to-policies-devops-resource-group.md#create-a-new-devops-policy)
* [Provision read/modify access to all sources in a subscription or resource group](./how-to-policies-data-owner-resource-group.md#create-and-publish-a-data-owner-policy)
