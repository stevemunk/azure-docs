# Monitoring Azure Virtual WAN

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation.

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Azure Virtual WAN. Virtual WAN uses [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md). If you're unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md).

## Virtual WAN Insights

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "Insights".

Virtual WAN uses Network Insights to provide users and operators with the ability to view the state and status of a Virtual WAN, presented via an autodiscovered topological map. Resource state and status overlays on the map give you a snapshot view of the overall health of the Virtual WAN. You can navigate resources on the map via one-click access to the resource configuration pages of the Virtual WAN portal. For more information, see [Azure Monitor Network Insights for Virtual WAN](azure-monitor-insights.md).

## Monitoring data

Virtual WAN collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md).

See [Monitoring Virtual WAN data reference](monitor-virtual-wan-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Virtual WAN.

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs aren't collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings.md) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for Virtual WAN are listed in [Virtual WAN monitoring data reference](monitor-virtual-wan-reference.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling these settings requires additional Azure services (storage account, event hub, or Log Analytics), which may increase your cost. To calculate an estimated cost, visit the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator).

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for Virtual WAN with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started.md) for details on using this tool.

For a list of the platform metrics collected for Virtual WAN, see [Monitoring Virtual WAN data reference metrics](monitor-virtual-wan-reference.md#metrics).  

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md).

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md).

The [Activity log](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md) is a type of platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring Virtual WAN data reference](monitor-virtual-wan-reference.md).

To analyze logs, go to your Virtual WAN gateway (User VPN or site-to-site VPN). In the **Essentials** section of the page, select **Logs -> View in Azure Monitor**. 

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types.md#metric-alerts), [logs](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types.md#log-alerts), and the [activity log](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types.md#activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.

To create a metric alert, see [Tutorial: Create a metric alert for an Azure resource](../azure-monitor/alerts/tutorial-metric-alert.md).
