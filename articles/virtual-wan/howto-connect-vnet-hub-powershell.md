# Connect a virtual network to a Virtual WAN hub - PowerShell

This article helps you connect your virtual network to your virtual hub using PowerShell. You can also use the [Azure portal](howto-connect-vnet-hub.md) to complete this task. Repeat these steps for each VNet that you want to connect.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * A virtual network can only be connected to one virtual hub at a time.
> * In order to connect it to a virtual hub, the remote virtual network can't have a gateway.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If VPN gateways are present in the virtual hub, this operation as well as any other write operation on the connected VNet can cause disconnection to point-to-site clients as well as reconnection of site-to-site tunnels and BGP sessions.

## Prerequisites

* Verify that you have an Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial).
* This tutorial creates a NAT rule on a VPN gateway that will be associated with a VPN site connection. The steps assume that you have an existing Virtual WAN VPN gateway connection to two branches with overlapping address spaces.

## Add a connection

1. Declare the variables for the existing resources including the existing Virtual Network.

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $resourceGroup = Get-AzResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName "testRG" 
   $virtualWan = Get-AzVirtualWan -ResourceGroupName "testRG" -Name "myVirtualWAN"
   $virtualHub = Get-AzVirtualHub -ResourceGroupName "testRG" -Name "westushub"
   $remoteVirtualNetwork = Get-AzVirtualNetwork -Name "MyVirtualNetwork" -ResourceGroupName "testRG" 
   ```

1. You can create a connection between a new virtual network or an already existing virtual network to peer the Virtual Network to the Virtual Hub. To create the connection:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   New-AzVirtualHubVnetConnection -ResourceGroupName "testRG" -VirtualHubName "westushub" -Name "testvnetconnection" -RemoteVirtualNetwork $remoteVirtualNetwork
   ```
