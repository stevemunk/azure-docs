# Quickstart: Set up Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Defender for Cloud provides unified security management and threat protection across your hybrid and multicloud workloads. While the free features offer limited security for your Azure resources only, enabling enhanced security features extends these capabilities to on-premises and other clouds. Defender for Cloud helps you find and fix security vulnerabilities, apply access and application controls to block malicious activity, detect threats using analytics and intelligence, and respond quickly when under attack. For pricing information, see the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/defender-for-cloud/).

This quickstart section will walk you through all the recommended steps to enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud and the enhanced security features. When you've completed all the quickstart steps, you'll have:

> [!div class="checklist"]

> - Defender for Cloud enabled on your Azure subscriptions
> - [Enhanced security features](enhanced-security-features-overview.md) enabled on your Azure subscriptions
> - Automatic data collection set up
> - [Email notifications set up](configure-email-notifications.md) for security alerts
> - Your hybrid and multicloud machines connected to Azure

## Prerequisites

To get started with Defender for Cloud, you must have a subscription to Microsoft Azure. If you don't have a subscription, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

In Defender for Cloud, you only see information related to a resource when you're assigned the Owner, Contributor, or Reader role for the subscription or for the resource group the resource is in.

## Enable Defender for Cloud on your Azure subscription

> [!TIP]
> To enable Defender for Cloud on all subscriptions within a management group, see [Enable Defender for Cloud on multiple Azure subscriptions](onboard-management-group.md).

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/azure-portal/).

1. From the portal's menu, select **Defender for Cloud**.

    Defender for Cloud's overview page opens.

    **Defender for Cloud â€“ Overview** provides a unified view into the security posture of your hybrid cloud workloads, helping you discover and assess the security of your workloads and to identify and mitigate risks.

    Defender for Cloud automatically enables any of your Azure subscriptions not previously onboarded by you or another subscription user.
