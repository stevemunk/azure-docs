# Quickstart: Connect your GCP projects to Microsoft Defender for Cloud

With cloud workloads commonly spanning multiple cloud platforms, cloud security services must do the same. Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects workloads in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), GitHub and Azure DevOps (ADO).

To protect your GCP-based resources, you can connect a GCP project with either:

- **Native cloud connector** (recommended) - Provides an agentless connection to your GCP account that you can extend with Defender for Cloud's Defender plans to secure your GCP resources:

  - [**Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**](overview-page.md) assesses your GCP resources according to GCP-specific security recommendations and reflects your security posture in your secure score. The resources are shown in Defender for Cloud's [asset inventory](asset-inventory.md) and are assessed for compliance with built-in standards specific to GCP.
  - [**Microsoft Defender for Servers**](defender-for-servers-introduction.md) brings threat detection and advanced defenses to [supported Windows and Linux VM instances](supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-servers.md?tabs=tab/features-multicloud). This plan includes the integrated license for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, security baselines and OS level assessments, vulnerability assessment scanning, adaptive application controls (AAC), file integrity monitoring (FIM), and more.
  - [**Microsoft Defender for Containers**](defender-for-containers-introduction.md) brings threat detection and advanced defenses to [supported Google GKE clusters](supported-machines-endpoint-solutions-clouds-containers.md). This plan includes Kubernetes threat protection, behavioral analytics, Kubernetes best practices, admission control recommendations, and more.
  - [**Microsoft Defender for SQL**](defender-for-sql-introduction.md) brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your SQL Servers running on GCP compute engine instances, including the advanced threat protection and vulnerability assessment scanning.

- **Classic cloud connector** - Requires configuration in your GCP project to create a user that Defender for Cloud can use to connect to your GCP environment. If you have classic cloud connectors, we recommend that you [delete these connectors](#remove-classic-connectors) and use the native connector to reconnect to the project. Using both the classic and native connectors can produce duplicate recommendations.

> [!NOTE]
> The option to select the classic connector is only available if you previously onboarded a GCP project using the classic connector.
>
> If you have classic cloud connectors, we recommend that you [delete these connectors](#remove-classic-connectors), and use the native connector to reconnect to the account. Using both the classic and native connectors can produce duplicate recommendations.

## Connect your GCP projects

When connecting your GCP projects to specific Azure subscriptions, consider the [Google Cloud resource hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy#resource-hierarchy-detail) and these guidelines:

- You can connect your GCP projects to Microsoft Defender for Cloud on the project level.
- You can connect multiple projects to one Azure subscription.
- You can connect multiple projects to multiple Azure subscriptions.

Follow the steps below to create your GCP cloud connector.

**To connect your GCP project to Defender for Cloud with a native connector**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Navigate to **Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings**.

1. Select **+ Add environment**.

1. Select the **Google Cloud Platform**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/google-cloud.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the location of the Google cloud environment button."  lightbox="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/google-cloud.png":::

1. Enter all relevant information.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/create-connector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Create GCP connector page where you need to enter all relevant information." lightbox="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/create-connector.png":::

   (Optional) If you select **Organization**, a management project and an organization custom role will be created on your GCP project for the onboarding process. Auto-provisioning will be enabled for the onboarding of new projects.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Defender for Cloud can be connected to each GCP project or organization only once.

1. Select the **Next: Select Plans**.

1. Toggle the plans you want to connect to **On**. By default all necessary prerequisites and components will be provisioned. (Optional) Learn how to [configure each plan](#optional-configure-selected-plans).

    1. (**Containers only**) Ensure you've fulfilled the [network requirements](defender-for-containers-enable.md?tabs=defender-for-container-gcp#network-requirements) for the Defender for Containers plan.

1. Select **Next: Configure access**.

    a. Choose deployment type, **Default access** or **Least privilege access**.

    - Default access - Allows Defender for Cloud to scan your resources and automatically include future capabilities.
    - Least privileged access - Grants Defender for Cloud access only to the current permissions needed for the selected plans. If you select the least privileged permissions, you'll receive notifications on any new roles and permissions that are required to get full functionality on the connector health section.

    b. Choose deployment method: **GCP Cloud Shell** or **Terraform**.

1. Follow the on-screen instructions for the selected deployment method to complete the required dependencies on GCP.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/gcp-configure-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the configure access and its deployment options and instructions.":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > To discover GCP resources and for the authentication process, the following APIs must be enabled: `iam.googleapis.com`, `sts.googleapis.com`, `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`, `iamcredentials.googleapis.com`, `compute.googleapis.com`. If these APIs are not enabled, we'll enable them during the onboarding process by running the GCloud script.

1. Ensure that the following resources were created:

    | CSPM | Defender for Containers|
    |--|--|
    | CSPM service account reader role <br> Microsoft Defender for Cloud identity federation <br> CSPM identity pool <br>*Microsoft Defender for Servers* service account (when the servers plan is enabled) <br>*Azure-Arc for servers onboarding* service account (when the Arc for servers auto-provisioning is enabled) | Microsoft Defender Containers’ service account role <br> Microsoft Defender Data Collector service account role <br> Microsoft Defender for Cloud identity pool |

After creating a connector, a scan will start on your GCP environment. New recommendations will appear in Defender for Cloud after up to 6 hours. If you enabled auto-provisioning, Azure Arc and any enabled extensions will install automatically for each new resource detected.

## (Optional) Configure selected plans

By default, all plans are `On`. You can disable plans that you don't need.

:::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/toggle-plans-to-on.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that all plans are toggle to on." lightbox="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/toggle-plans-to-on.png":::

### Configure the servers plan

Connect your GCP VM instances to Azure Arc in order to have full visibility to Microsoft Defender for Servers security content.

Microsoft Defender for Servers brings threat detection and advanced defenses to your GCP VMs instances.
To have full visibility to Microsoft Defender for Servers security content, ensure you have the following requirements configured:

- Microsoft Defender for Servers enabled on your subscription. Learn how to enable plans in the [Enable enhanced security features](enable-enhanced-security.md) article.

- Azure Arc for servers installed on your VM instances.
  - **(Recommended) Auto-provisioning** - Auto-provisioning is enabled by default in the onboarding process and requires owner permissions on the subscription. Arc auto-provisioning process is using the OS config agent on GCP end. Learn more about the [OS config agent availability on GCP machines](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#vm-manager).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Arc auto-provisioning process leverages the VM manager on your Google Cloud Platform to enforce policies on the your VMs through the OS config agent. A VM with an [Active OS agent](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/manage-os#agent-state) will incur a cost according to GCP. Refer to [GCP's technical documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vm-manager#pricing) to see how this may affect your account.
    > <br><br> Microsoft Defender for Servers does not install the OS config agent to a VM that does not have it installed. However, Microsoft Defender for Servers will enable communication between the OS config agent and the OS config service if the agent is already installed but not communicating with the service.
    > <br><br> This can change the OS config agent from `inactive` to `active` and will lead to additional costs.

    - **Manual installation** - You can manually connect your VM instances to Azure Arc for servers. Instances in projects with Defender for Servers plan enabled that aren't connected to Arc will be surfaced by the recommendation “GCP VM instances should be connected to Azure Arc”. Use the “Fix” option offered in this recommendation to install Azure Arc on the selected machines.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The respective Azure Arc servers for EC2 instances or GCP virtual machines that no longer exist (and the respective Azure Arc servers with a status of ["Disconnected" or "Expired"](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview)) will be removed after 7 days. This process removes irrelevant Azure ARC entities, ensuring only Azure Arc servers related to existing instances are displayed.

- Ensure you've fulfilled the [network requirements for Azure Arc](../azure-arc/servers/network-requirements.md?tabs=azure-cloud).

- Other extensions should be enabled on the Arc-connected machines.
  - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
  - VA solution (Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management/ Qualys)
  - Log Analytics (LA) agent on Arc machines or Azure Monitor agent (AMA). Ensure the selected workspace has security solution installed.

      The LA agent and AMA are currently configured in the subscription level, such that all the multicloud accounts and projects (from both AWS and GCP) under the same subscription will inherit the subscription settings regarding the LA agent and AMA.

      Learn more about [monitoring components](monitoring-components.md) for Defender for Cloud.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Defender for Servers assigns tags to your GCP resources to manage the auto-provisioning process. You must have these tags properly assigned to your resources so that Defender for Cloud can manage your resources:
    **Cloud**, **InstanceName**, **MDFCSecurityConnector**, **MachineId**, **ProjectId**, **ProjectNumber**

**To configure the Servers plan**:

1. Follow the steps to [Connect your GCP project](#connect-your-gcp-project).

1. On the Select plans screen select **View configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/view-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select to configure the Servers plan.":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-gcp/auto-provision-screen.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the toggle switches for the Servers plan.":::

    > [!Note]
    > If Azure Arc is toggled **Off**, you will need to follow the manual installation process mentioned above.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Continue from step number 8 of the [Connect your GCP projects](#connect-your-gcp-projects) instructions.

### Configure the Databases plan

Connect your GCP VM instances to Azure Arc in order to have full visibility to Microsoft Defender for SQL security content.

Microsoft Defender for SQL brings threat detection and vulnerability assessment to your GCP VM instances.
To have full visibility to Microsoft Defender for SQL security content, ensure you have the following requirements configured:

- Microsoft SQL servers on machines plan enabled on your subscription. Learn how to enable plan in the [Enable enhanced security features](quickstart-enable-database-protections.md) article.

- Azure Arc for servers installed on your VM instances.
  - **(Recommended) Auto-provisioning** - Auto-provisioning is enabled by default in the onboarding process and requires owner permissions on the subscription. Arc auto-provisioning process is using the OS config agent on GCP end. Learn more about the [OS config agent availability on GCP machines](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/os-details#vm-manager).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Arc auto-provisioning process leverages the VM manager on your Google Cloud Platform, to enforce policies on the your VMs through the OS config agent. A VM with an [Active OS agent](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/manage-os#agent-state) will incur a cost according to GCP. Refer to [GCP's technical documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vm-manager#pricing) to see how this may affect your account.
    > <br><br> Microsoft Defender for Servers does not install the OS config agent to a VM that does not have it installed. However, Microsoft Defender for Servers will enable communication between the OS config agent and the OS config service if the agent is already installed but not communicating with the service.
    > <br><br> This can change the OS config agent from `inactive` to `active` and will lead to additional costs.
- Other extensions should be enabled on the Arc-connected machines.
  - SQL servers on machines. Ensure the plan is enabled on your subscription.
  - Log Analytics (LA) agent on Arc machines. Ensure the selected workspace has security solution installed.

      The LA agent and SQL servers on machines plan are currently configured in the subscription level, such that all the multicloud accounts and projects (from both AWS and GCP) under the same subscription will inherit the subscription settings and may result in extra charges.
