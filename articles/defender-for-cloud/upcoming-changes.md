### Replacing the "Key Vaults should have purge protection enabled" recommendation with combined recommendation "Key Vaults should have deletion protection enabled". 

**Estimated date for change: June 2023**

The `Key Vaults should have purge protection enabled` recommendation is deprecated from the (regulatory compliance dashboard/Azure security benchmark initiative) and replaced with a new combined recommendation `Key Vaults should have deletion protection enabled`. 

| Recommendation name | Description | Effect(s) | Version |
|--|--|--|--|
| [Key vaults should have deletion protection enabled](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/PolicyDetailBlade/definitionId/%2Fproviders%2FMicrosoft.Authorization%2FpolicyDefinitions%2F0b60c0b2-2dc2-4e1c-b5c9-abbed971de53)| A malicious insider in your organization can potentially delete and purge key vaults. Purge protection protects you from insider attacks by enforcing a mandatory retention period for soft deleted key vaults. No one inside your organization or Microsoft will be able to purge your key vaults during the soft delete retention period. | audit, deny, disabled | [2.0.0](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policyDefinitions/Key%20Vault/KeyVault_Recoverable_Audit.json) |

See the [full index of Azure Policy built-in policy definitions for Key Vault](../key-vault/policy-reference.md)

### Changes to the Defender for DevOps recommendations environment source and resource ID

**Estimated date for change: July 2023**

The Security DevOps recommendations will be updated to align with the overall Microsoft Defender for Cloud features and experience.  Affected recommendations will point to a new recommendation source environment and have an updated resource ID.


Security DevOps recommendations impacted:
-	Code repositories should have code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Code repositories should have secret scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Code repositories should have dependency vulnerability scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Code repositories should have infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have code scanning enabled (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have Dependabot scanning enabled (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have secret scanning enabled (preview)

The recommendation environment source will be updated from `Azure` to `AzureDevOps` or `GitHub`. 

The format for resource IDs will be changed from:

`Microsoft.SecurityDevOps/githubConnectors/owners/repos/`

To:

`Microsoft.Security/securityConnectors/devops/azureDevOpsOrgs/projects/repos`
`Microsoft.Security/securityConnectors/devops/gitHubOwners/repos`

As a part of the migration, source code management system specific recommendations will be created for security findings:
-	GitHub repositories should have code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have secret scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have dependency vulnerability scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have code scanning enabled (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have Dependabot scanning enabled (preview)
-	GitHub repositories should have secret scanning enabled (preview)
-	Azure DevOps repositories should have code scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Azure DevOps repositories should have secret scanning findings resolved (preview)
-	Azure DevOps repositories should have infrastructure as code scanning findings resolved (preview)

Customers that rely on the `resourceID` to query DevOps recommendation data will be affected. For example, Azure Resource Graph queries, workbooks queries, API calls to Microsoft Defender for Cloud. 

Queries will need to be updated to include both the old and new `resourceID` to show both, for example, total over time.  

The recommendations page's experience will have minimal impact and deprecated assessments may continue to show for a maximum of 14 days if new scan results aren't submitted.  

### DevOps Resource Deduplication for Defender for DevOps

**Estimated date for change: July 2023**

To improve the Defender for DevOps user experience and enable further integration with Defender for Cloud's rich set of capabilities, Defender for DevOps will no longer support duplicate instances of a DevOps organization to be onboarded to an Azure tenant. 

If you don't have an instance of a DevOps organization onboarded more than once to your organization, no further action is required. If you do have more than one instance of a DevOps organization onboarded to your tenant, the subscription owner will be notified and will need to delete the DevOps Connector(s) they don't want to keep by navigating to Defender for Cloud Environment Settings. 

Customers will have until July 31, 2023 to resolve this issue. After this date, only the most recent DevOps Connector created where an instance of the DevOps organization exists will remain onboarded to Defender for DevOps. For example, if Organization Contoso exists in both connectorA and connectorB, and connectorB was created after connectorA, then connectorA will be removed from Defender for DevOps.

### General Availability (GA) release of Agentless Container Posture in Defender CSPM

**Estimated date for change: July 2023**

The new Agentless Container Posture capabilities are set for General Availability (GA) as part of the Defender CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) plan.

With this release, the recommendation `Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by MDVM)` is set for General Availability (GA):

|Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key|
|--|--|--|
| Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)| Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for commonly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and provides a detailed vulnerability report for each image. This recommendation provides visibility to vulnerable images currently running in your Kubernetes clusters. Remediating vulnerabilities in container images that are currently running is key to Â improving your security posture, significantly reducing the attack surface for your containerized workloads. |dbd0cb49-b563-45e7-9724-889e799fa648 <br> is replaced by  c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5

Customers with both Defender for Containers plan and Defender CSPM plan should [disable the Qualys recommendation](tutorial-security-policy.md#disable-a-security-recommendation), to avoid multiple reports for the same images with potential impact on secure score. If you're currently using the sub-assesment API or Azure Resource Graph or continuous export, you should also update your requests to the new schema used by the MDVM recommendation prior to disabling the Qualys recommendation and using MDVM results instead.

If you are also using our public preview offering for Windows containers vulnerability assessment powered by Qualys, and you would like to continue using it, you need to [disable Linux findings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-vulnerability-assessment-azure#disable-specific-findings) using disable rules rather than disable the registry recommendation.

### Recommendation set to be released for GA: Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)â¯

**Estimated date for change: July 2023**

The recommendation `Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)` is set to be released as GA (General Availability):

|Recommendation | Description | Assessment Key|
|--|--|--| 
| Running container images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management)â¯| Container image vulnerability assessment scans your registry for commonly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and provides a detailed vulnerability report for each image. This recommendation provides visibility to vulnerable images currently running in your Kubernetes clusters. Remediating vulnerabilities in container images that are currently running is key to improving your security posture, significantly reducing the attack surface for your containerized workloads. | c609cf0f-71ab-41e9-a3c6-9a1f7fe1b8d5

 Customers with both Defender for the Containers plan and Defender CSPM plan should [disable the Qualys running containers recommendation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-security-policy#disable-a-security-recommendation), to avoid multiple reports for the same images with potential impact on the secure score.

If you're currently using the sub-assesment API or Azure Resource Graph or continuous export, you should also update your requests to the new schema used by the MDVM recommendation prior to disabling the Qualys recommendation and use MDVM results instead.

If you are also using our public preview offering for Windows containers vulnerability assessment powered by Qualys, and you would like to continue using it, you need to [disable Linux findings](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-containers-vulnerability-assessment-azure#disable-specific-findings) using disable rules rather than disable the runtime recommendation.

### Change to the Log Analytics daily cap

Azure monitor offers the capability to [set a daily cap](../azure-monitor/logs/daily-cap.md) on the data that is ingested on your Log analytics workspaces. However, Defender for Cloud security events are currently not supported in those exclusions.

Starting on September 18, 2023 the Log Analytics Daily Cap will no longer exclude the below set of data types: 

- WindowsEvent
- SecurityAlert
- SecurityBaseline
- SecurityBaselineSummary
- SecurityDetection
- SecurityEvent
- WindowsFirewall
- MaliciousIPCommunication
- LinuxAuditLog
- SysmonEvent
- ProtectionStatus
- Update
- UpdateSummary 
- CommonSecurityLog
- Syslog

At that time, all billable data types will be capped if the daily cap is met. This change improves your ability to fully contain costs from higher-than-expected data ingestion.
