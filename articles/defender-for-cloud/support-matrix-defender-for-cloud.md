# Support matrices for Defender for Cloud

This article indicates the Azure clouds, Azure services, and client operating systems that are supported by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

## Security benefits for Azure services

Defender for Cloud provides recommendations, security alerts, and vulnerability assessment for these Azure services:

<sup><a name="footnote1"></a>1</sup> Partially GA: Support for Azure Arc-enabled clusters is in public preview and not available on Azure Government.

<sup><a name="footnote3"></a>3</sup> Partially GA: Some of the threat protection alerts from Microsoft Defender for Storage are in public preview.

<sup><a name="footnote4"></a>4</sup> These features all require [Microsoft Defender for Servers](./defender-for-servers-introduction.md).

<sup><a name="footnote5"></a>5</sup> There may be differences in the standards offered per cloud type.
 
<sup><a name="footnote6"></a>6</sup> Partially GA: Subset of alerts and vulnerability assessment for SQL servers. Behavioral threat protections aren't available.

## Supported operating systems

Defender for Cloud depends on the [Azure Monitor Agent](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview) or the [Log Analytics agent](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent). Make sure that your machines are running one of the supported operating systems as described on the following pages:

- Azure Monitor Agent
    - [Azure Monitor Agent for Windows supported operating systems](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#windows)
    - [Azure Monitor Agent for Linux supported operating systems](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#linux)
- Log Analytics agent
    - [Log Analytics agent for Windows supported operating systems](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#windows)
    - [Log Analytics agent for Linux supported operating systems](/azure/azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview#linux)

Also ensure your Log Analytics agent is [properly configured to send data to Defender for Cloud](working-with-log-analytics-agent.md#manual-agent).

To learn more about the specific Defender for Cloud features available on Windows and Linux, see:

- Defender for Servers support for [Windows](support-matrix-defender-for-servers.md#windows-machines) and [Linux](support-matrix-defender-for-servers.md#linux-machines) machines
- Defender for Containers [support for Windows and Linux containers](support-matrix-defender-for-containers.md#defender-for-containers-feature-availability)

> [!NOTE]
> Even though Microsoft Defender for Servers is designed to protect servers, most of its features are supported for Windows 10 machines. One feature that isn't currently supported is [Defender for Cloud's integrated EDR solution: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](integration-defender-for-endpoint.md).

## Next steps
