# Onboard Defender for APIs

This article describes how to deploy the [Microsoft Defender for APIs](defender-for-apis-introduction.md) plan in the Microsoft Defender for Cloud portal. Defender for APIs is currently in preview.

## Before you start

- Review [Defender for APIs support, permissions, and requirements](defender-for-apis-introduction.md) before you begin deployment.
- Make sure that Defender for Cloud is enabled in your Azure subscription. You enable Defender for APIs at the subscription level.
- Ensure that APIs you want to secure are published in [Azure API management](/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts). Follow [these instructions](/azure/api-management/get-started-create-service-instance) to set up Azure API Management.

> [!NOTE]
> This article describes how to enable and onboard the Defender for APIs plan in the Defender for Cloud portal. Alternately, you can [enable Defender for APIs within an API Management instance](../api-management/protect-with-defender-for-apis.md) in the Azure portal.

## Enable the plan

1. Sign into the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and in Defender for Cloud, select **Environment settings**.
1. Select the subscription that contains the managed APIs that you want to protect.
1. In the **APIs** plan, select **On**. Then select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> After enabling Defender for APIs, onboarded APIs take up to 50 minutes to appear in the **Recommendations** tab. Security insights are available in the **Workload protections** > **API security** dashboard within 40 minutes of onboarding.

## Onboard APIs

1. In the Defender for Cloud portal, select **Recommendations**.
1. Search for *Defender for APIs*.
1. Under **Enable enhanced security features**, select the security recommendation **Azure API Management APIs should be onboarded to Defender for APIs**.

1. In the recommendation page, you can review the recommendation severity, update interval, description, and remediation steps.
1. Review the resources in scope for the recommendations:
    - **Unhealthy resources**: Resources that aren't onboarded to Defender for APIs.
    - **Healthy resources**: API resources that are onboarded to Defender for APIs.
    - **Not applicable resources**: API resources that aren't applicable for protection.

1. In **Unhealthy resources**, select the APIs that you want to protect with Defender for APIs.
1. Select **Fix**.

1. Verify that remediation was successful.

## Track onboarded API resources

After onboarding the API resources, you can track their status in the Defender for Cloud portal > **Workload protections** > **API security**.
