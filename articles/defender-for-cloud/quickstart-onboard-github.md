# Quickstart: Connect your GitHub repositories to Microsoft Defender for Cloud 

With cloud workloads commonly spanning multiple cloud platforms, cloud security services must do the same. Microsoft Defender for Cloud protects workloads in Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), GitHub, and Azure DevOps (ADO).

To protect your GitHub-based resources, you can connect your GitHub organizations on the environment settings page in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This page provides a simple onboarding experience (including auto discovery). 

By connecting your GitHub repositories to Defender for Cloud, you'll extend Defender for Cloud's enhanced security features to your GitHub resources. These features include:

- **Defender for Cloud's Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) features** - Assesses your GitHub resources according to GitHub-specific security recommendations. You can also learn about all of the [recommendations for DevOps](recommendations-reference.md) resources. Resources are assessed for compliance with built-in standards that are specific to DevOps. Defender for Cloud's [asset inventory page](asset-inventory.md) is a multicloud enabled feature that helps you manage your GitHub resources alongside your Azure resources.

- **Defender for Cloud's Cloud Workload Protection features** - Extends Defender for Cloud's threat detection capabilities and advanced defenses to your GitHub resources.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with Defender for Cloud onboarded. If you don't already have an Azure account [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- To use all advanced security capabilities provided by GitHub Connector in Defender for DevOps, you need to have GitHub Enterprise with GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) enabled.

## Availability

    > [!NOTE] 
    > The authorization will auto-login using the session from your browser tab. After you select Authorize, if you do not see the GitHub organizations you expect to see, check whether you are logged in to MDC in one browser tab and logged in to GitHub in another browser tab. 
    > After authorization, if you wait too long to install the DevOps application, the session will time out and you will receive an error message.

1. Select **Install**.

The Defender for DevOps service automatically discovers the repositories you selected and analyzes them for any security issues. Initial repository discovery can take up to 10 minutes during the onboarding process. 

When auto-discovery is selected during the onboarding process, it can take up to 4 hours for repositories to appear after onboarding is completed. The auto-discovery process detects any new repositories and connects them to Defender for Cloud.

The Inventory page populates with your selected repositories, and the Recommendations page shows any security issues related to a selected repository. This can take up to 3 hours or more.
