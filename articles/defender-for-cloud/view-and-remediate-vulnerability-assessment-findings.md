# View and remediate vulnerability assessment findings for registry images

Defender for Cloud filters and classifies findings from the scanner and presents them as a list of recommendations. 

First review and remediate vulnerabilities exposed via [attack paths](how-to-manage-attack-path.md), as those findings pose the greatest risk to your security posture; then use the following procedures to view, remediate, prioritize, and monitor vulnerability findings for your containers.

## View findings of Vulnerability Assessment for Containers 

Vulnerability Assessment for Containers reports vulnerabilities to Defender for Cloud, Defender for Cloud presents the findings and related information as recommendations, including related information such as remediation steps and relevant CVEs. You can view the identified vulnerabilities for one or more subscriptions, or for a specific resource.

The resources are grouped into tabs:  

- **Healthy resources** – relevant resources, which either aren't impacted or on which you've already remediated the issue.  
- **Unhealthy resources** – resources that are still impacted by the identified issue.  
- **Not applicable resources** – resources for which the recommendation can't give a definitive answer. The not applicable tab also includes reasons for each resource.  

 To view the findings, do the following:  

1. Open the **Recommendations** page. If issues were found, you'll see the recommendation [Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by MDVM)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5).

1. Select the recommendation; the recommendation details page opens with additional information. This information includes the list of registries with vulnerable images ("Affected resources") and the remediation steps.

1. Select a specific registry to see the repositories in it that have vulnerable images. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-specific-registry.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select the specific registry." lightbox="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-specific-registry.png":::

    The registry details page opens with the list of affected repositories. 

1. Select a specific repository to see the images in it that are vulnerable. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-specific-repo.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select the specific repository." lightbox="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-specific-repo.png":::

    The repository details page opens. It lists the vulnerable images together with an assessment of the severity of the findings. 

1. Select a specific image to see the vulnerabilities. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-specific-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing where to select the specific image." lightbox="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/select-specific-image.png"::: 
    
1. The list of findings for the selected image opens.

    :::image type="content" source="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/list-of-findings-on-image.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the list of findings on the specific image." lightbox="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/list-of-findings-on-image.png":::

1. To learn more about a finding, select the finding; the findings details pane opens. 
 
    :::image type="content" source="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/image-finding-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the finding details of the image." lightbox="media/view-and-remediate-vulnerability-assessment-findings/image-finding-details.png"::: 

    This pane includes a detailed description of the issue and links to external resources to help mitigate the threats, and information on the software version that contributes to resolving the vulnerability.  

## Remediate the vulnerability for images in the registry 

1. Follow the steps in the remediation section of the recommendation pane. 
1. When you've completed the steps required to remediate the security issue, replace the image in your registry: 
1. Push the updated image to trigger a scan; it may take up to 24 hours for the previous image to be removed from the results, and for the new image to be included in the results.
1. Check the recommendations page for the recommendation [Container registry images should have vulnerability findings resolved (powered by MDVM)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c0b7cfc6-3172-465a-b378-53c7ff2cc0d5). 
    If the recommendation still appears and the image you've handled still appears in the list of vulnerable images, check the remediation steps again. 
1. When you're sure the updated image has been pushed, scanned, and is no longer appearing in the recommendation, delete the “old” vulnerable image from your registry. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Kubernetes deployments using the vulnerable images must be updated with the new patched images.
