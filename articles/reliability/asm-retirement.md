# Azure Service Manager retirement

Azure Service Manager (ASM) is the old control plane of Azure responsible for creating, managing, deleting VMs and performing other control plane operations, and has been in use since 2011. ASM is retiring in August 2024, and customers can now migrate to [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview). ARM provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account. You can use management features like access control, locks, and tags to secure and organize your resources after deployment.

## Benefits of migrating to ARM 
Migrating from the classic resource model to ARM offers several benefits, including: 

- **Simplified management**: ARM provides a [unified platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) for managing and deploying resources, allowing for easier provisioning, monitoring, and updating of infrastructure components.
- **Improved security**: ARM incorporates robust security features, such as [role-based access control (RBAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) and [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview), to help protect resources and provide automatic credential management
- **High Availability and Resiliency**: [Availability Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview) allow customers to run mission-critical applications with higher availability and fault tolerance to datacenter failures
- **High Scalability**: ARM enables [automatic scaling](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/scalability/design-scale) of resources based on demand, ensuring applications can handle increased workloads efficiently.
- **Cost optimization**: ARM provides features like [cost management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/) and [resource tagging](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/tag-resources), enabling better visibility and control over resource usage, leading to cost optimization and efficient resource allocation.


There are many service-related benefits which can be found in the migration guides. 

## Services being retired 
To help with this transition, we are providing a range of resources and tools, including documentation and migration guides. We encourage you to begin planning your migration to ARM as soon as possible to ensure that you can continue to take advantage of the latest Azure features and capabilities.
