# Quickstart: Create a Cognitive Services resource using the Azure Management client library

Use this quickstart to create and manage Azure Cognitive Services resources using the Azure Management client library.

Azure Cognitive Services are cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services that help developers build cognitive intelligence into applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. They are available through REST APIs and client library SDKs in popular development languages. Azure Cognitive Services enables developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications with cognitive solutions that can see, hear, speak, and analyze.

Individual AI services are represented by Azure [resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resources-portal.md) that you create under your Azure subscription. After you create a resource, you can use the keys and endpoint generated to authenticate your applications.
