[Library source code](https://github.com/openai/openai-python?azure-portal=true) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/openai?azure-portal=true) |

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- Access granted to the Azure OpenAI service in the desired Azure subscription.
    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access?azure-portal=true).
- [Python 3.7.1 or later version](https://www.python.org?azure-portal=true).
- The following Python libraries: os.
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with the `gpt-35-turbo` model deployed. This model is currently available in East US and South Central US. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Set up

Install the OpenAI Python client library with:

```console
pip install openai
```

> [!NOTE]
> This library is maintained by OpenAI and is currently in preview. Refer to the [release history](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/releases) or the [version.py commit history](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/commits/main/openai/version.py) to track the latest updates to the library.

### Retrieve key and endpoint

To successfully make a call against Azure OpenAI, you'll need an **endpoint** and a **key**.

|Variable name | Value |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `ENDPOINT`               | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in the **Azure OpenAI Studio** > **Playground** > **Code View**. An example endpoint is: `https://docs-test-001.openai.azure.com/`.|
| `API-KEY` | This value can be found in the **Keys & Endpoint** section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`.|

Go to your resource in the Azure portal. The **Endpoint and Keys** can be found in the **Resource Management** section. Copy your endpoint and access key as you'll need both for authenticating your API calls. You can use either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. Always having two keys allows you to securely rotate and regenerate keys without causing a service disruption.

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the overview blade for an OpenAI Resource in the Azure portal with the endpoint & access keys location circled in red." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/endpoint.png":::

Create and assign persistent environment variables for your key and endpoint.

### Environment variables

# [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

```CMD
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" 
```

```CMD
setx OPENAI_API_BASE "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" 
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENAI_API_KEY', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE', 'User')
```

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENAI_API_BASE', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE', 'User')
```

# [Bash](#tab/bash)

```Bash
echo export OPENAI_API_KEY="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

```Bash
echo export OPENAI_API_BASE="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE" >> /etc/environment && source /etc/environment
```

## Create a new Python application

1. Create a new Python file called quickstart.py. Then open it up in your preferred editor or IDE.

2. Replace the contents of quickstart.py with the following code:

    ```python
    #Note: The openai-python library support for Azure OpenAI is in preview.
    import os
    import openai
    openai.api_type = "azure"
    openai.api_base = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_BASE") 
    openai.api_version = "2022-12-01"
    openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-35-turbo",
        prompt="<|im_start|>system\nThe system is an AI assistant that helps people find information.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nDoes Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant",
        temperature=1,
        max_tokens=800,
        top_p=0.95,
        frequency_penalty=0,
        presence_penalty=0,
        stop=["<|im_end|>"])

    print(response['choices'][0]['text'])
    ```

3. Run the application with the `python` command on your quickstart file:

    ```console
    python quickstart.py
    ```

## Output

```console
Yes, Azure OpenAI supports customer managed keys, which allow customers to control access to their data and models. Additionally, Azure OpenAI supports Azure Key Vault integration which allows customers to manage and control access to keys and other secrets in Azure.'
```

### Understanding the prompt structure

ChatGPT was trained to use special tokens to delineate different parts of the prompt. Content is provided to the model in between `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` tokens. The prompt begins with a system message which can be used to prime the model by including context or instructions for the model. After that, the prompt contains a series of messages between the user and the assistant.

The assistant's response to the prompt will then be returned below the `<|im_start|>assistant` token and will end with `<|im_end|>` denoting that the assistant has finished its response.

The [ChatGPT how-to guide](../how-to/chatgpt.md) provides an in-depth introduction into the new prompt structure and how to use the new model effectively.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure CLI](../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)
