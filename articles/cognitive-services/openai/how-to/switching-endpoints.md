# How to switch between OpenAI and Azure OpenAI endpoints with Python

While OpenAI and Azure OpenAI Service rely on a [common Python client library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), there are small changes you need to make to your code in order to swap back and forth between endpoints. This article walks you through the common changes and differences you'll experience when working across OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.

> [!NOTE]
> This library is maintained by OpenAI and is currently in preview. Refer to the [release history](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/releases) or the [version.py commit history](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/commits/main/openai/version.py) to track the latest updates to the library.

## Authentication

We recommend using environment variables. If you haven't done this before our [Python quickstarts](../quickstart.md) walk you through this configuration.

### API key

<table>
<tr>
<td> OpenAI </td> <td> Azure OpenAI </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "sk-..."
openai.organization = "..."


```

</td>
<td>

```python
import openai

openai.api_type = "azure"
openai.api_key = "..."
openai.api_base = "https://example-endpoint.openai.azure.com"
openai.api_version = "2023-05-15"  # subject to change
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Azure Active Directory authentication

<table>
<tr>
<td> OpenAI </td> <td> Azure OpenAI </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "sk-..."
openai.organization = "..."






```

</td>
<td>

```python
import openai
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
token = credential.get_token("https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default")

openai.api_type = "azuread"
openai.api_key = token.token
openai.api_base = "https://example-endpoint.openai.azure.com"
openai.api_version = "2023-05-15"  # subject to change
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Keyword argument for model

OpenAI uses the `model` keyword argument to specify what model to use. Azure OpenAI has the concept of [deployments](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal#deploy-a-model) and uses the `deployment_id` keyword argument to describe which model deployment to use. Azure OpenAI also supports the use of `engine` interchangeably with `deployment_id`.

For OpenAI `engine` still works in most instances, but it's deprecated and `model` is preferred.

<table>
<tr>
<td> OpenAI </td> <td> Azure OpenAI </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```python
completion = openai.Completion.create(
    prompt="<prompt>",
    model="text-davinci-003"
)
  
chat_completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    messages="<messages>",
    model="gpt-4"
)

embedding = openai.Embedding.create(
  input="<input>",
  model="text-embedding-ada-002"
)




```

</td>
<td>

```python
completion = openai.Completion.create(
    prompt="<prompt>",
    deployment_id="text-davinci-003"
    #engine="text-davinci-003" 
)
  
chat_completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    messages="<messages>",
    deployment_id="gpt-4"
    #engine="gpt-4"

)

embedding = openai.Embedding.create(
  input="<input>",
  deployment_id="text-embedding-ada-002"
  #engine="text-embedding-ada-002"
)
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Azure OpenAI embeddings doesn't support multiple inputs

Many examples show passing multiple inputs into the embeddings API. For Azure OpenAI, currently we must pass a single text input per call.

<table>
<tr>
<td> OpenAI </td> <td> Azure OpenAI </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```python
inputs = ["A", "B", "C"]

embedding = openai.Embedding.create(
  input=inputs,
  model="text-embedding-ada-002"
)


```

</td>
<td>

```python
inputs = ["A", "B", "C"]

for text in inputs:
    embedding = openai.Embedding.create(
        input=text,
        deployment_id="text-embedding-ada-002"
        #engine="text-embedding-ada-002"
    )
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>
