# Quickstart: Real-time Conversation Transcription

You can transcribe meetings and other conversations with the ability to add, remove, and identify multiple participants by streaming audio to the Speech service. You first create voice signatures for each participant using the REST API, and then use the voice signatures with the Speech SDK to transcribe conversations. See the Conversation Transcription [overview](conversation-transcription.md) for more information.

## Limitations

* Only available in the following subscription regions: `centralus`, `eastasia`, `eastus`, `westeurope`
* Requires a 7-mic circular multi-microphone array. The microphone array should meet [our specification](./speech-sdk-microphone.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The Speech SDK for C++, Java, Objective-C, and Swift support Conversation Transcription, but we haven't yet included a guide here.
