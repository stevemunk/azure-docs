# What are Azure Cognitive Services?

Azure Cognitive Services are cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services that help developers build cognitive intelligence into applications without having direct AI or data science skills or knowledge. They are available through REST APIs and client library SDKs in popular development languages. Azure Cognitive Services enables developers to easily add cognitive features into their applications with cognitive solutions that can see, hear, speak, and analyze.

## Categories of Cognitive Services

Cognitive Services can be categorized into five main areas:

* Vision
* Speech
* Language
* Decision
* Azure OpenAI Service

See the tables below to learn about the services offered within those categories. 

## Vision APIs

|[Translator](./translator/index.yml "Translator")|Translator provides machine-based text translation in near real time.| [Translator quickstart](./translator/quickstart-translator.md)|
|[Language Understanding LUIS](./luis/index.yml "Language Understanding")|Language Understanding (LUIS) is a cloud-based conversational AI service that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational or natural language text to predict overall meaning and pull out relevant information. |[LUIS quickstart](./luis/luis-get-started-create-app.md)|
|[QnA Maker](./qnamaker/index.yml "QnA Maker")|QnA Maker allows you to build a question and answer service from your semi-structured content.| [QnA Maker quickstart](./qnamaker/quickstarts/create-publish-knowledge-base.md) |

## Decision APIs

|Service Name|Service Description| Quickstart|
|:-----------|:------------------|--|
|[Anomaly Detector](./anomaly-detector/index.yml "Anomaly Detector") |Anomaly Detector allows you to monitor and detect abnormalities in your time series data.| [Anomaly Detector quickstart](./anomaly-detector/quickstarts/client-libraries.md) |
|[Content Moderator](./content-moderator/overview.md "Content Moderator")|Content Moderator provides monitoring for possible offensive, undesirable, and risky content. | [Content Moderator quickstart](./content-moderator/client-libraries.md)|
|[Personalizer](./personalizer/index.yml "Personalizer")|Personalizer allows you to choose the best experience to show to your users, learning from their real-time behavior. |[Personalizer quickstart](./personalizer/quickstart-personalizer-sdk.md)|

## Azure OpenAI

|Service Name | Service Description| Quickstart|
|:------------|:-------------------|-----------|
|[Azure OpenAI](./openai/index.yml "Azure OpenAI") |Powerful language models including the GPT-3, Codex and Embeddings model series for content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. | [Azure OpenAI quickstart](./openai/quickstart.md) |

## Create a Cognitive Services resource

You can create a Cognitive Services resource with hands-on quickstarts using any of the following methods:

* [Azure portal](cognitive-services-apis-create-account.md?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows "Azure portal")
* [Azure CLI](cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md?tabs=windows "Azure CLI")
* [Azure SDK client libraries](cognitive-services-apis-create-account-client-library.md?tabs=windows "cognitive-services-apis-create-account-client-library?pivots=programming-language-csharp")
* [Azure Resource Manager (ARM template)](./create-account-resource-manager-template.md?tabs=portal "Azure Resource Manager (ARM template)")

## Use Cognitive Services in different development environments

With Azure and Cognitive Services, you have access to several development options, such as:

* Automation and integration tools like Logic Apps and Power Automate.
* Deployment options such as Azure Functions and the App Service. 
* Cognitive Services Docker containers for secure access.
* Tools like Apache Spark, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Azure Kubernetes Service for big data scenarios. 

To learn more, see [Cognitive Services development options](./cognitive-services-development-options.md).

### Containers for Cognitive Services

Azure Cognitive Services also provides several Docker containers that let you use the same APIs that are available from Azure, on-premises. These containers give you the flexibility to bring Cognitive Services closer to your data for compliance, security, or other operational reasons. For more information, see [Cognitive Services Containers](cognitive-services-container-support.md "Cognitive Services Containers").

## Subscription management

Once you are signed in with your Microsoft Account, you can access [My subscriptions](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/subscriptions "My subscriptions") to show the products you are using, the quota remaining, and the ability to add additional products to your subscription.

## Upgrade to unlock higher limits

All APIs have a free tier, which has usage and throughput limits.  You can increase these limits by using a paid offering and selecting the appropriate pricing tier option when deploying the service in the Azure portal. [Learn more about the offerings and pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/ "offerings and pricing"). You'll need to set up an Azure subscriber account with a credit card and a phone number. If you have a special requirement or simply want to talk to sales, click "Contact us" button at the top the pricing page.
