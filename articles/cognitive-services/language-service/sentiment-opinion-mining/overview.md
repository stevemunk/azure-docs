# What is sentiment analysis and opinion mining in Azure Cognitive Service for Language?

Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are features offered by [Azure Cognitive Service for Language](../overview.md), a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud for developing intelligent applications that involve written language. These features help you find out what people think of your brand or topic by mining text for clues about positive or negative sentiment, and can associate them with specific aspects of the text. 

Both sentiment analysis and opinion mining work with a variety of [written languages](./language-support.md).

## Sentiment analysis 

The sentiment analysis feature provides sentiment labels (such as "negative", "neutral" and "positive") based on the highest confidence score found by the service at a sentence and document-level. This feature also returns confidence scores between 0 and 1 for each document & sentences within it for positive, neutral and negative sentiment. 

## Opinion mining

Opinion mining is a feature of sentiment analysis. Also known as aspect-based sentiment analysis in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this feature provides more granular information about the opinions related to words (such as the attributes of products or services) in text.

## Responsible AI 

An AI system includes not only the technology, but also the people who use it, the people who will be affected by it, and the environment in which it's deployed. Read the [transparency note for sentiment analysis](/legal/cognitive-services/language-service/transparency-note-sentiment-analysis?context=/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/context/context) to learn about responsible AI use and deployment in your systems.

## Next steps

There are two ways to get started using the entity linking feature:
* [Language Studio](../language-studio.md), which is a web-based platform that enables you to try several Language service features without needing to write code.
* The [quickstart article](quickstart.md) for instructions on making requests to the service using the REST API and client library SDK.
