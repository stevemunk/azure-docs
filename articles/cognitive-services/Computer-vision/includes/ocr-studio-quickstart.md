## Prerequisites

* Sign in to [Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/) with your Azure subscription and Cognitive Services resource. See the [Get started section](../overview-vision-studio.md#get-started-using-vision-studio) of the overview if you need help with this step.



## Read printed and handwritten text

1. Select the **Extract text** tab, and select panel titled **Extract text from images**.
1. To use the try-it-out experience, you'll need to choose a resource and acknowledge it will incur usage according to your [pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/computer-vision/).
1. Select an image from the available set, or upload your own.
1. After you select your image, you'll see the extracted text appear in the output window. You can also select the **JSON** tab to see the JSON output that the API call returns.
1. Below the try-it-out experience are next steps to start using this capability in your own application.
