Use the OCR client library to read printed and handwritten text from a remote image. The OCR service can read visible text in an image and convert it to a character stream. For more information on text recognition, see the [Optical character recognition (OCR)](../../overview-ocr.md) overview.

> [!TIP]
> You can also read text from a local image. See the [ComputerVisionClientOperationsMixin](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision.operations.computervisionclientoperationsmixin) methods, such as **read_in_stream**. Or, see the sample code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/blob/master/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart.py) for scenarios involving local images.

[Reference documentation](/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision) | [Package (PiPy)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision/) | [Samples](/samples/browse/?products=azure&terms=computer-vision)

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
  * Your Python installation should include [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). You can check if you have pip installed by running `pip --version` on the command line. Get pip by installing the latest version of Python.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesComputerVision"  title="Create a Computer Vision resource"  target="_blank">create a Computer Vision resource</a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click **Go to resource**.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to the Computer Vision service.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.



[!INCLUDE [create environment variables](../environment-variables.md)]

## Read printed and handwritten text

1. Install the client library.

    You can install the client library with:

    ```console
    pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
    ```

    Also install the Pillow library.

    ```console
    pip install pillow
    ```

1. Create a new Python application

    Create a new Python file&mdash;*quickstart-file.py*, for example. Then open it in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. Replace the contents of *quickstart-file.py* with the following code.

   [!code-python[](~/cognitive-services-quickstart-code/python/ComputerVision/ComputerVisionQuickstart-single.py?name=snippet_single)]

1. As an optional step, see [How to specify the model version](../../how-to/call-read-api.md#determine-how-to-process-the-data-optional). For example, to explicitly specify the latest GA model, edit the `read` statement as shown. Skipping the parameter or using `"latest"` automatically uses the most recent GA model.

   ```python
      # Call API with URL and raw response (allows you to get the operation location)
      read_response = computervision_client.read(read_image_url,  raw=True, model_version="2022-04-30")
   ```

1. Run the application with the `python` command on your quickstart file.

   ```console
   python quickstart-file.py
   ```



## Output

```console
===== Read File - remote =====
The quick brown fox jumps
[38.0, 650.0, 2572.0, 699.0, 2570.0, 854.0, 37.0, 815.0]
Over
[184.0, 1053.0, 508.0, 1044.0, 510.0, 1123.0, 184.0, 1128.0]
the lazy dog!
[639.0, 1011.0, 1976.0, 1026.0, 1974.0, 1158.0, 637.0, 1141.0]

End of Computer Vision quickstart.
```



## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.

* [Azure CLI](../../../cognitive-services-apis-create-account-cli.md#clean-up-resources)


## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to install the OCR client library and use the Read API. Next, learn more about the Read API features.
