## Create a VM for your sensor

This procedure describes how to create a VM for your sensor with VMware ESXi. 

Defender for IoT also supports other processes, such as using Hyper-V or physical sensors. For more information, see [Defender for IoT installation](how-to-install-software.md).

**To create a VM for your sensor**:

1. Make sure that you have the sensor software downloaded and accessible, and that VMware is running on your machine.

1. Sign in to the ESXi, choose the relevant **datastore**, and select **Datastore Browser**.

1. **Upload** the image and select **Close**.

1. Go to **Virtual Machines**, and then select **Create/Register VM**.

1. Select **Create new virtual machine**, and then select **Next**.

1. Add a sensor name and then define the following options:

   - Compatibility: **&lt;latest ESXi version&gt;**

   - Guest OS family: **Linux**

   - Guest OS version: **Ubuntu Linux (64-bit)**

1. Select **Next**.

1. Choose the relevant datastore and select **Next**.

1. Change the virtual hardware parameters according to the required specifications for your needs. For more information, see the [table in the Prerequisites](#hw) section above.

1. For **CD/DVD Drive 1**, select **Datastore ISO file** and select the Defender for IoT software you'd [downloaded earlier](#download-software-for-your-virtual-sensor).

1. Select **Next** > **Finish**.

1. Power on the VM, and open a console.

## Install sensor software

This procedure describes how to install the sensor software on your VM.

**To install the software on the virtual sensor**:

1. Open the VM console.

1. The VM will start from the ISO image, and the language selection screen will appear. Select **English**.

1. Select the required specifications for your needs, as defined in the [table in the Prerequisites](#hw) section above.

1. Define the appliance profile and network properties as follows:

    - **Appliance** to check that the system is running. Verify that each line item shows **Running** and that the last line states that the **System is up**.
    - **Version** to verify that you have the correct version installed.
    - **ifconfig** to verify that all input interfaces configured during installation are running.

## Configure a SPAN port

Virtual switches don't have mirroring capabilities. However, for the sake of this tutorial you can use *promiscuous mode* in a virtual switch environment to view all network traffic that goes through the virtual switch.

This procedure describes how to configure a SPAN port using a workaround with VMware ESXi.


> [!NOTE]
> Promiscuous mode is an operating mode and a security monitoring technique for a VM's interfaces in the same portgroup level as the virtual switch to view the switch's network traffic. Promiscuous mode is disabled by default but can be defined at the virtual switch or portgroup level.
>

**To configure a SPAN port with ESXi**:

1. Open vSwitch properties.

1. Select **Add**.

1. Select **Virtual Machine** > **Next**.

1. Insert a network label **SPAN Network**, select **VLAN ID** > **All**, and then select **Next**.

1. Select **Finish**.

1. Select **SPAN Network** > **Edit*.

1. Select **Security**, and verify that the **Promiscuous Mode** policy is set to **Accept** mode.

1. Select **OK**, and then select **Close** to close the vSwitch properties.

1. Open the **XSense VM** properties.

1. For **Network Adapter 2**, select the **SPAN** network.

1. Select **OK**.

1. Connect to the sensor, and verify that mirroring works.

## Onboard and activate the virtual sensor
